My other body was gone, and the battle was 
over.
#
As we expected, the damage was severe, and the
people still in the independent areas asked for
help from the city.
They decided to join us.
#
And the Angels who had stayed behind to keep
fighting slowly began to withdraw without 
Wadatsumi leading them and pulling their
strings.
#
But the truth might be that they suffered
extensive damage from my tentacles and could
no longer effectively fight.
#
There are still some people in the independent
areas still resisting, but they're unlikely to
seriously attack us, so it's not worth worrying
too much about.
#
However, that doesn't mean we can celebrate.
#
My body's attack severely damaged the city and
Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
In some places, it's even worse than when the
castles fell.
#
It hurts my head trying to think about how long
it's going to take to rebuild.

 We'll manage."

 Overlord!"

 T-That's my... Aaah!"

I start to come inside Miartei.

 Me next."

 H-Haven't you... my breasts...
 Mm...aah..."

"What? You want me to rub them harder?"

"Aahh...mmm...
 Suisen's become quite well-behaved as well."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0272">
"Yes, she has."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0313">
"That's not..."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0556">
"We are all completely exposed to each other
 here.
 There's no point hiding it."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0273">
"I feel the same way."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0314">
"I, um...
 It's just thanks for Sue..."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0557">
"If you're so worried about her, then you
 shouldn't be forcing her to do anything so
 dangerous."

<name "Miartei" "!SA0274">
"That's right."

<name "Suisen" "!YA0315">
"He said it wouldn't be dangerous..."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0558">
"You may be a merchant, but you do have your
 weak points."

<name "Miartei" "!SA0275">
"No wonder Gunguskar is beating you."

<name "Suisen" "!YA0316">
"I haven't lost yet.
 Anselm is hard at work rebuilding the city."
#
<name "Darx">
"It's certainly been helpful."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0317">
"See?"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1000">
"That's fine, but..."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0276">
"Aah!"
#
<name "Darx">
"W-What is it?"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1001">
"Don't give me that.
 What do you think you're doing!?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?
 Oh, uh, see?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0559">
"We were just improving relations between the
 Overlord and Celestia."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0277">
"That's right.
 Suisen also said she wanted to formally
 apologize."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0318">
"I-I didn't exactly..."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1002">
"While Anselm has been very helpful, quite a
 bit of work has been unable to progress due to
 your absence.
 Overlord, Kyuriha, and you too, Miartei."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1003">
"This is not the time to be flouncing around."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0278">
"Eeeh? But..."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1004">
"I'm already mad.
 Get dressed."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0279">
"Y-Yes, ma'am."
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0249">
"The image of my sister keeps falling apart."
#
I was able to build a cordial relationship with
the three angels.
