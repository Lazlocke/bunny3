<name "Farren" "!FB0166">
"What about you, Tamaga?"

<name "Tamaga" "!PB0120">
"No problems."
#
<name "Farren" "!FB0167">
"Lotta, quit playing around."
#
<name "Lotta" "!HB0097">
"Hey. Why is it so obvious to you I'm playing?"
#
<name "Farren" "!FB0168">
"Are you not?"
#
<name "Lotta" "!HB0098">
"Maybe I am, but..."
#
<name "Farren" "!FB0169">
"Don't slack off.

"Miss Farren... I mean, Farren, the temporary

 Can you check it?"
#
<name "Farren" "!FB0170">
"Yes, but since when am I in charge of that?"
#
<name "Raffino" "!EB0094">
"Isn't it for security?"
#
<name "Farren" "!FB0171">
"Security..."
#
<name "Raffino" "!EB0095">
"I mean, if you put one of them in charge, 
 who is it?"

 See? All done!"

<name "Hibi" "!DB0053">
"Um..."
#
<name "Yahnu" "!NB0064">
"What?"
#
<name "Hibi" "!DB0054">
"You built that in the wrong place."

<name "Yahnu" "!NB0065">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0089">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Nein" "!QA0121">
"You're right!
 Ah! I was looking at the map upside down!"

".........That's a difficult question."
#
<name "Raffino" "!EB0096">
"Right?"
#
<name "Raffino" "!EB0097">
"Besides, it seems like you're working harder

"I-I didn't mean to..."
#
<name "Raffino" "!EB0098">
"Let's all work hard for the Overlord."
#

"Yes."
