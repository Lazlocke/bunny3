"Father."

<name "Darx">
"Hey."
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0296">
"Mm.
 Obligatory family time?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Something like that."
#
<name "Energetic Girl" "!HC0195">
"It's Daddy!"
#
<name "Running Girl" "!SB0264">
"Daddy! Daddy!"
#
<name "Graceful Girl" "!RB0175">
"Father."
#
<name "Energetic Girl" "!HC0196">
"Hahaha..."
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0297">
"Darx, are you able to remember all your 
 children's names?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't worry.
 Fina, Maria, Elinitei, Meniaus." 
#
<name "Darx">
"The cute one over there is Kozelotte.
 The sleeping one if Oldeus."
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0298">
"Mm.
 As I expected."
#
<name "Darx">
"I was worried about that for a while too, but
 when it's your own kids, you remember."
#
<name "Darx">
"I know all of them."
#
<name "Darx">
"Panitte and Panitto are a little difficult
 though...
 Hm?"
#
I look down to who's pulling on my sleeves.
#
<name "Energetic Girl" "!HC0197">
"Daddy, I'm cute too."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, you are.
 Sorry, sorry."
#
I hug Fina tight.
#
<name "Running Girl" "!SB0265">
"Me too, Daddy."
#
<name "Graceful Girl" "!RB0176">
"Me too, me too."
#
I hug them all, one after another.
#
<name "Kozelotte" "!NA0174">
"Hahaha...
 Me too."
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0299">
"...Me too."
#
<name "Darx">
"I-I knew it'd turn out like this..."
#
I'm crushed under their affection, but the
weight is pure happiness.
