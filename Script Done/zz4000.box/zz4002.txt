"Please make sure you do your job."
#

<name "Darx">
"Roger."

<name "Sofia" "!ZB1008">
"Meryl is here to report."
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0080">
"Two forces in the independent area have made
 new offers to become vassals, which we 
 accepted as per your orders."
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0081">
"Also, the repairs around the royal palace in
 Forzelotte's Shrine have finished.
 That's all I have to report."
#
<name "Darx">
"Didn't you say before that we were putting off
 that area?"
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0082">
"That was the plan, but volunteers insisted
 that it was important."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1009">
"Overlord, you are very revered."
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0083">
"No. Forzelotte wanted it fixed right away 
 because it's a path that Kozelotte uses..."
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0084">
"Sorry.
 I should've held my tongue."
#
<name "Darx">
"Definitely.
 Good work."
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0085">
"Please come visit us in Forzelotte's Shrine
 once in a while."
#

#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1010">
"Rakia will report next."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0472">
"I have to report that there's been a change in
 the budget in the reconstruction plans.
 Please see here."
#
<name "Darx">
"It's cheaper?"
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0473">
"We can't let Anselm outdo us."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sorry."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0474">
"It's fine.
 Gunguskar looks forward to your continued
 business."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0475">
"Sofia, you keep working hard too, okay?"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1011">
"Yes, ma'am."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0476">
"And... I hear that Suisen of Anselm is now
 offering herself to him?"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1012">
"Huh?
 Oh..."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0477">
"Don't let her outdo you."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1013">
"Hahaha...
 I'll try."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0478">
"Then, excuse me."
#
She leaves the room.
#
<name "Darx">
"You're not being outdone, you know?"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1014">
"Yes.
 I have her beat, in both times and affection."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I'm counting on you."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1015">
"Leave it to me."
#
I nod in satisfaction at her reply.
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1016">
"And please look at this document.
 It needs two signatures."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, yeah.
 I'll do my best too."
