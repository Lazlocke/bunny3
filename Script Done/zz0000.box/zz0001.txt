<name "Sofia" "!ZB1020">
"Hello.
 I'm Sofia, a little different from the maids
 who just work part time."
#
<name "Darx">
"She's sure fired up."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta08a004.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0479">
"She's been promoted to a full fledged 
 employee, so I know the feeling."
#
<sprite "ta08a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0480">
"By the way, just being part time doesn't mean
 they can quit whenever they feel like it.
 It might be more accurate to call them 
 contract employees and sort of part time."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sofia did say she was a part timer a while
 ago."
#
<sprite "ta08a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0481">
"Indeed.
 Most people in Gunguskar below the rank of
 sergeant are part timers."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sergeant?"
#
<sprite "ta08a023.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0482">
"Under the rank of general, colonel and
 lieutenant are, from top to bottom, sergeant,
 corporal, private first class, and private
 second class."
#
<sprite "ta08a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0483">
"Also, generals are split by general, lt.
 general, and major general. Colonels are
 colonel, lt. colonel, and major. Captains are
 captain, lieutenant, and ensign."
#
<name "Darx">
"What exactly does a sergeant do?"
#
<sprite "ta08a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0484">
"Lead the part timers."
#
<name "Darx">
"...So you're saying Sofia lead the part timers
 until recently, but got a big promotion?"
#
<sprite "ta08a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0485">
"That's correct.
　She's an ensign, so it's like she's become a
 cashier."
#
<name "Darx">
"I genuinely don't understand Gunguskar's
 ranks.
 By the way, what are you?"
#
<sprite "ta08a023.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0486">
"I became a colonel a little while ago."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I don't know if that's impressive or not."
#
<sprite "ta08a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0487">
"Right?
 Well, it's fine if you don't understand that
 very well."
#
<sprite "ta08a022.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0488">
"Just remember that Macdo is a major general,
 which is far above me.
 What you do can reflect badly on my chances
 for a promotion."
#
<name "Darx">
"I'll keep that in mind.
 ...Hm?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta01a028.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1021">
"Awww...
 I thought this was part of the main story!"
