"There's Kyuriha, and Miartei..."
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0043" "ka14a000.agf">
"Me, Ultinia, and Izana."
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0044" "ka14a000.agf">
"And Marialis and Filliane."
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0045" "ka14a000.agf">
"We could form a whole angel army."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0012" "ka28a000.agf">
"In a way, could you say that Celestia has
 taken over here?"
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0012" "ka29a000.agf">
"Indeed."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0013" "ka29a000.agf">
"In short, though it's supposedly belongs to
 the Netherworld, it's actually Celestia's."
#
<name "Darx">
"What is this?
 Betrayal planning?"
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0046" "ka14a000.agf">
"No, just trying to think about how to convince
 the angel warriors who are still refusing to
 surrender."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 Any other ideas?"
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0047" "ka14a000.agf">
"The Netherworld government has fewer laws
 than Celestia, so it's easier living here."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0014" "ka29a000.agf">
"As long as there's no major issues, the angels
 who betrayed their allies living here don't
 want to go back."
#
<name "Darx">
"Major issue?"
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0015" "ka29a000.agf">
"Like their parents got sick, or for a 
 grandmother's funeral."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0016" "ka29a000.agf">
"Oh, we let those people leave."
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0048" "ka14a000.agf">
"But 90% come back."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0017" "ka29a000.agf">
"I lost my chastity here, so there's no place
 for me in Celestia."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0013" "ka28a000.agf">
"Yep."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0018" "ka29a000.agf">
"I'd like to continue this conversation, but
 we're running short on time, so shall we call
 an end to this break?"
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0049" "ka14a000.agf">
"Okay."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0014" "ka28a000.agf">
"Then, Overlord, if you're please continue."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, yeah."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I enjoy myself with them.
