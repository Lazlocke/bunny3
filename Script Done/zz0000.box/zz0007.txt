"Fantasy games can't use modern terminology."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0208">
"Well, usually."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0190">
"But it's fake fantasy, so it has stuff like
 sunglasses, glasses, sweatshirts, and 
 underwear that's usually modern."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0209">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0191">
"But there's still words that bother the
 writers."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0210">
"Like what?"
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0192">
"For example... dynamite."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0193">
"This is an era that clearly doesn't have
 dynamite. I mean, it's a fantasy without
 gunpowder, so dynamite's..."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0211">
"I mean, they never use it, right?"
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0194">
"Dynamite body."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0212">
"Oh, I see."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0195">
"Or piston movement."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0196">
"There might be piston devices, but it's
 clearly a world where piston motion is not
 at all common."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0197">
"That's a big problem when the story is told
 in the first person from the protagonist."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0198">
"I understand that a lot of fantasy stories
 these days have some kind of reincarnation or
 summoning from the modern world."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0213">
"It's an easy way to express yourself and
 create a connection."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0199">
"Yeah. It's kind of the 20xx of our time."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0214">
"Well, anyway, now that you've said that, I
 had my own thoughts."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0200">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0215">
"You're overthinking things.
 Just don't worry about it and just express 
 yourself."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0201">
"Eeeh?"
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0216">
"Don't worry.
 Nobody cares about that stuff, and you always
 mess it up somehow somewhere."
#
<name "Thinking Angel" "!QB0202">
"I-I guess you might be right..."
#
<name "Resting Angel" "!WB0217">
"Yep.
 End of story."
