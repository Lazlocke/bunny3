<name "Paniverna" "!DA0036" "ka14a000.agf">
"Um...
 Ekate seems a little dangerous right now..."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0001" "ka32a000.agf">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0001" "ka33a000.agf">
"Hey, we've gotta do something about that."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0001" "ka28a000.agf">
"Would it be so bad if she killed Macdo?"
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0001" "ka29a000.agf">
"If it wasn't, wouldn't the Overlord have
 killed her already?"
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0002" "ka28a000.agf">
"He goes easy when it's a woman."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0002" "ka29a000.agf">
"That's not how I'd put it."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0003" "ka28a000.agf">
"I guess, but still..."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0002" "ka32a000.agf">
"We're getting off track."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0002" "ka33a000.agf">
"I think it'd be okay to kill Macdo myself."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0003" "ka29a000.agf">
"Why?"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0003" "ka33a000.agf">
"Right when she got here, she was supposed to
 be testing the Overlord's abilities, so if she
 died, that'd mean we killed her, right?"
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0004" "ka29a000.agf">
"Yes."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0004" "ka33a000.agf">
"But now that it's changed to her staying here
 and evaluating him, if she died, can't we
 say it was an accident and send someone else
 in her place?"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0005" "ka33a000.agf">
"Well, we'd be in trouble if the second person
 also died."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0001" "ka26a000.agf">
"Naive!
 Too naive!"
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0002" "ka26a000.agf">
"The Great Overlord might overlook it, but the
 people around him would not."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0003" "ka26a000.agf">
"If it was us, if one of our people died
 somewhere, we'd be mad, even if it was an
 accident."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0004" "ka26a000.agf">
"It's the same for them."
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0037" "ka14a000.agf">
"I'd be mad, but..."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0005" "ka29a000.agf">
"The question is how important Macdo is to the
 Great Overlord and those around him."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0006" "ka33a000.agf">
"Does anybody know that?"
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0004" "ka28a000.agf">
"We're in no place to say..."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0005" "ka26a000.agf">
"Even if you think that, look at the
 situation."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0006" "ka26a000.agf">
"The Overlord is working hard, all by himself,
 to prove himself."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0007" "ka26a000.agf">
"If Macdo dies, we would be betraying that
 effort."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0008" "ka26a000.agf">
"Do you really not believe me?"
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0005" "ka28a000.agf">
"Y-You're right..."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0009" "ka26a000.agf">
"So he will absolutely not praise you for it!
 The opposite! He will give praise to whoever
 stops Ekate from killing her!"
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0038" "ka14a000.agf">
"Let's stop Ekate."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0006" "ka29a000.agf">
"Yes."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0006" "ka28a000.agf">
"If we must."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0007" "ka33a000.agf">
"I don't want anybody to get hurt though."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0007" "ka29a000.agf">
"If all of us surround her, I think we could
 manage it."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0007" "ka28a000.agf">
"Surround her?
 Then who takes the front?"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0003" "ka32a000.agf">
"There's no choice...
 I..."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0010" "ka26a000.agf">
"No.
 I'm the one who insisted on stopping her.
 I'll do it."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0008" "ka33a000.agf">
"I had you all wrong."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0004" "ka32a000.agf">
"Yeah. I thought you despised the Overlord."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0011" "ka26a000.agf">
"That is not true.
 Hahahaha!
 Come, let's fight our best!"

And so, Logius and friends were able to prevent
Ekate from killing Macdo.

"Owww..."

<name "Logius" "!PA0013" "ka26a000.agf">
"We pulled it off somehow."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0014" "ka26a000.agf">
"That was close.
 The Overlord was about to come back."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0015" "ka26a000.agf">
"The precious peace I finally have.
 I'll do anything to protect Aly and Fran.
 I will..."

"Heheheh..."
