"Why did you suddenly want to become graceful
 anyway?"

"Heheh.
 Darx, I have always been graceful."

 Graceful?
 Wasn't your nickname the warrior princess?"

 ran away from her marriage."

 them to call it off."

 good approached her on his hands and knees

 by telling him to quit wasting her time."

 So that's it.
 I see.
 So that was the trigger."

"That's not why she ran. 
 She was refusing to have a matchmaking picture

 Her parents were in tears."

 Didn't her much younger sister find a
 boyfriend and rush right into marriage?"

 That's why she has such a soft spot for Ru."

 You're adorable, Kyuriha."
