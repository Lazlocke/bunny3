<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0196">
"Macdo of the Netherworld."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0197">
"Kyuriha, Miartei, and Suisen of Celestia."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0198">
"They were supposedly strong in the Netherworld
 and Celestia, but they seem a little weak in
 the human world."
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0282">
"When you travel from those places to the 
 human world, there's only so much mana you can
 take with you."
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0283">
"In other words, they get weakened."
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0284">
"At the start, Macdo was like that because she 
 was using some device to suppress her mana."
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0286">
"Her mana had already been reduced to a level
 where it could be reduced like that, otherwise
 you'd just mass-produce those devices and turn
 them into weapons."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0199">
"Oh, I see."
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0287">
"Same for Celestia."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0200">
"Oh?"
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0201">
"So when the Overlord went to the Netherworld,
 was he weakened too?"
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0288">
"Unfortunately, at his level, he wouldn't run
 into the limitation."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0202">
"Oh, I see."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0203">
"By the way, why is there a limit?"
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0289">
"Obviously, to prevent dragons from going to
 the Netherworld or Celestia."
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0291">
"Long ago, some female dragon terrorized them,
 so they hurriedly put up a barrier."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0204">
"Oh?"
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0292">
"But after making it, no dragon ever attacked
 it, so it's not clear if it even works."
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0293">
"It's incredibly unpopular with angels and
 demons who don't know how scary dragons are.
 It also interferes with traveling."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0205">
"That's true."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0206">
"That feels like a retcon, but it works!"
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0294">
"I-I mean, this setting's been around for a
 long time...
 There could be some plot holes here and
 there."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0207">
"What an awful writer."
#
<name "Knowing Citizen" "!GB0295">
"Don't be like that."
#
<name "Wondering Citizen" "!LB0208">
"Okay, bye bye."
