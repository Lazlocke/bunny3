"Why are bunny suits so sexy?"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0066" "ka32a000.agf">
"I think it's because of the image that rabbits
 are weak."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0105" "ka33a000.agf">
"No, no. You're naive, Golan."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0106" "ka33a000.agf">
"It's probably the sexiness you get in a bunny
 suit. I think it's the same kind you get with
 a cat or tiger suit."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0107" "ka33a000.agf">
"In other words, there's a sexy factor in 
 common with all of them! What I care about is
 the tights! Yes! The sexiness of a bunny suit
 is the tights! The tights!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0067" "ka32a000.agf">
"Nrrgh..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't rush to conclusions, Tojo."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0108" "ka33a000.agf">
"Then is there something else?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Bunny suits aren't commonly worn."
#
<name "Darx">
"Like a nurse or waitress outfit, they're a
 job uniform!"
#
<name "Darx">
"What's more, unlike a nurse or waitress, it's
 one of many jobs that requires one to be a
 woman!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0068" "ka32a000.agf">
"T-That's true."
#
<name "Darx">
"We derive the answer from that!
 And it's...
 Coercion!"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0109" "ka33a000.agf">
"Coercion?"
#
<name "Example Guard" "!TC0187">
"I really don't want to wear this, but I have
 to because it's my job."
#
<name "Darx">
"Like that!"
#
<name "Example Guard" "!TC0188">
"N-No, this outfit...
 I can't... 
 I-I understand.
 You'll go easy on me if I wear it, right?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Like that!"
#
<name "Example Guard" "!TC0189">
"Darksy, I'm going to take care of you in this
 special outfit today, so cheer up!☆"
#
<name "Darx">
"That!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0069" "ka32a000.agf">
"So they're wearing it reluctantly."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yes!
 That's the appeal!
 Their preference!
 Almost no women wear bunny suits!"
#
<name "Darx">
"They do it because someone told them to, or
 for someone!"
#
<name "Darx">
"That's the heart of what makes bunny suits
 sexy!"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0110" "ka33a000.agf">
"I-I see."
#
<name "Darx">
"I can prove it, Golan."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0070" "ka32a000.agf">
"What?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Take your scary wife.
 Let's say she greets you wearing a bunny suit.
 How about that?"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0071" "ka32a000.agf">
"S-Sexy.
 And I could feel her love...
 I definitely wouldn't be able to help but feel
 like she put it on just for me."
#
<name "Darx">
"Heheheh..."
#
<name "Darx">
"How about that?"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0072" "ka32a000.agf">
"S-Splendid.
 I concede."
#
<name "Darx">
"Mmhmm.
 As an aside, I totally agree with Tojo on the
 sexiness of tights.
 That's a good thing."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0111" "ka33a000.agf">
"By the way, do you like to pull tights off?
 Or are you the ripping type?
 I like to pull them."
#
<name "Darx">
"My heart is wide.
 Both are great."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0112" "ka33a000.agf">
"Ooh!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0073" "ka32a000.agf">
"What an open mind."
#
<name "Darx">
"So, in conclusion."
#
<name "Darx">
"Bunny suits are sexy."
#
<name "Darx">
"Because someone said to wear them, or they're
 worn for someone.
 That's the heart of it."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0074" "ka32a000.agf">
"I'll make a note of it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Mmhmm."
#
<name "Darx">
"Okay, next topic."
#
<name "Darx">
"Why doesn't this game have any bunny suits?"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0113" "ka33a000.agf">
"That's a big problem."
