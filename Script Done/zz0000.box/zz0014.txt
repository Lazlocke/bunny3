"Tentacles!
 Run away!"

<name "Fighting Citizen" "!BC0224">
"I-It's no good.
 They've already caught up..."
#
<name "Fighting Citizen" "!BC0225">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Leader Citizen" "!ZD0182">
"The tentacles avoided you... and started
 attacking that cute girl next to you!"
#
<name "Leader Citizen" "!ZD0183">
"Could that mean..."
#
<name "Fighting Citizen" "!BC0226">
"Look out!
 ...Huh?
 It ran away."
#
<name "Leader Citizen" "!ZD0184">
"I get it!
 These tentacles hate men!"
#
<name "Fighting Citizen" "!BC0227">
"Eeh!?"
#
<name "Leader Citizen" "!ZD0185">
"There's the proof!"
#
<name "Leader Citizen" "!ZD0186">
"The tentacle that was attacking that girl ran
 away!"
#
<name "Leader Citizen" "!ZD0187">
"Okay, I get it.
 I got it.
 I'm not afraid any more."
#
<name "Woman Citizen" "!LB0193">
"Let's build a wall of men."
#
<name "Helping Citizen" "!GB0280">
"Yes."
#
<name "Woman Citizen" "!LB0194">
"If we tie them to trees, they'll stay standing
 even if they're exhausted."
#
<name "Helping Citizen" "!GB0281">
"And we could then swing them around..."
#
<name "Leader Citizen" "!ZD0188">
"Huh?
 Um..."
#
<name "Woman Citizen" "!LB0195">
"It's to preotect us from the tentacles."
#
<name "Leader Citizen" "!ZD0189">
"E-Eeeeh!?"
#
The men of the city became more afraid of the
women on their side than of the enemy 
tentacles.
