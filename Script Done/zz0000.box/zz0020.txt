"This is a weird topic to bring up."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0312">
"What?"
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0199">
"What does 120% output mean?"
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0313">
"...Huh?"
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0200">
"I'm saying, what do they mean when they say
 something is at 120% output?"
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0314">
"Well...
 Isn't it that the output is at 120%?"
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0201">
"Isn't the maximum output 100%?
 How do you go 20% above that?"
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0315">
"Output is energy created by some kind of
 power source."
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0202">
"Yeah, I know."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0316">
"Let's use this energy cannon here."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0317">
"So 100% normally is it working in perfect
 condition. So if it's working at 100% output,
 it can operate at its full capacity."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0318">
"So, say it's at full, but you push it a little
 harder than that.
 Wouldn't that be 120%?"
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0203">
"Then isn't that 120% the actual 100%?
 So wouldn't it be better to shoot it at
 around 85%?"
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0319">
"Maybe if you go past 100% too much, there's
 the danger that it could break down?
 Or wear down the cannon more quickly."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0320">
"Like I said before, 100% is it working at
 full capacity.
 If you push past that, things can get dicey."
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0204">
"I see.
 Thank you.
 I understand better now."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0321">
"I mean, I just gave a reasonable answer.
 I don't know if it's the right one."
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0205">
"No, it's correct."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0322">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0206">
"Going past 100% output is used for battleship
 engines.
 Basically, it's all about combat speed."
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0207">
"Going past 100% hurts the engine, so normally,
 it's held back by a limiter, but it doesn't
 make sense to lose the battle in order to
 spare the engine."
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0208">
"So you forcibly remove the limiter during 
 combat and overheat the engine.
 So you pass the normal 100% and can get to
 120%."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0323">
"If you knew all that, why'd you have me
 explain?"
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0209">
"I'm bad at small talk."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0324">
"...Then I guess you had to."
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0210">
"Yeah, no helping it."
#
Two more hours pass, and their dates never
showed up.
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0325">
"Should I move to the other seat?
 It's awkward sitting next to you this long..."
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0211">
"No, not yet.
 They could still come."
#
They ended up waiting six more hours, until the
bar closed.
#
<name "Darx">
"Why are you talking about modern stuff in a
 fantasy story?"
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0212">
"It's hard to explain things with the right
 words when you have to stick to only stuff
 in a fantasy world."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0326">
"For example."
#
<name "Harvesting Citizen" "!KB0327">
"Now Mimiyak's huddling with Bigitan."
#
<name "Drinking Citizen" "!CB0213">
"Instead of being sports commentary when you
 don't know the rules, it feels like listening
 to some incomprehensible academic lecture."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see..."
