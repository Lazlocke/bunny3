"A haunted house?"

<name "Host" "!ZD0193">
"Yes."
#
<name "Darx">
"I'm going to ask again.
 A haunted house?"
#
<name "Host" "!ZD0194">
"Yes."
#
<name "Darx">
"...You built a haunted house, and are telling
 people to come see it."
#
<name "Host" "!ZD0195">
"Yes.
 Is that bad?"
#
<name "Darx">
"No, I'm pretty interesting.
 Let's see it."

"Welcome!"
#
<name "Darx">
"It's supposed to be a haunted house, but it's
 so bright."
#
<name "Greeter" "!BC0229">
"Go on, please enjoy yourself."
#
<name "Darx">
"Scary, huh?"
#
<name "Greeter" "!BC0230">
"It'll make you pale."
#
<name "Darx">
"Okay, let's go."
#
<name "Greeter" "!BC0231">
"Ah, Overlord.
 Pardon me.
 Please go in by yourself."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I can't take my subordinates with me?"
#
<name "Greeter" "!BC0232">
"No."
#

It took me a little bit to get ready, but I
managed to enter the haunted house, and come 
out the other end.

"..."
#
<name "Greeter" "!BC0233">
"How was it?"
#
<name "Darx">
"So that's a haunted house?"
#
<name "Greeter" "!BC0234">
"Yes, a lot of people faint.
 But you remain unfazed!
 Just as we'd expect of our Overlord!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Hahaha!"
#
Most of the ghosts were human adventurers who
had attacked me, then a dragon in the middle,
and at the end, a mannequin of me.
#
<name "Darx">
"I was scared though."
#
Though more than scared, I was ready to fight.
#
That me at the end was quite prettied up
though, if I do say so myself.
#
It did work at sending chills down my spine,
but is anybody really scared of that?
#
<name "Crying Guard" "!QB0213">
"Aieee..."
#
<name "Scared Guard" "!WB0225">
"So scary..."
#
I really want to believe it wasn't the doll of
me that scared them.
#
And then there's another loud scream.
#
Sounded like the middle...
Around the dragon?

"Are you okay, Kyuriha?
 Still alive?
 It's just a fake!
 A fake!"

 I was surprised too."

 end.
 Yes, I want to talk to them personally."

<name "Kozelotte" "!NA0180">
"Huh?
 There's already a backlog of orders?
 Grrr... I'm too late."

#
<name "Spooked Citizen" "!CB0197">
"Adventurers are scary."
#
<name "Scared Citizen" "!KB0311">
"Yeah, after that sudden surprise attack right
 when I went in, I thought I'd piss myself."
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
W-Well, as long as they enjoy themselves.
