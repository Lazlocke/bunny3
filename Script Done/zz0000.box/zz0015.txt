"There are many theories about why Celestia
 treats bloodlines as so important, but the
 most believed is elemental specialization."
#
<name "Darx">
"Elemental specialization?
 Like... fire, or water?"
#
<sprite "ta15a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0125">
"That's right."
#
<sprite "ta15a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0126">
"For Celestia, the war with the Netherworld was
 set the moment Celestia was created. In
 our limited world, you need to be individually
 powerful to fight the vast Netherworld."
#
<sprite "ta15a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0127">
"So the theory is that it became important to
 bring people together by their element to
 attempt to focus power, which became a focus
 on pedigree."
#
<sprite "ta15a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0128">
"The evidence of this is that Celestia is ruled
 by the Holy Light and the eight lineages.
 They're the same as the elements of magic, 
 plus the Holy Spirit as elemental-less."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<sprite "ta15a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0129">
"That's why Celestia prizes bloodlines so
 much."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, a question."
#
<sprite "ta15a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0130">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Why was it set that Celestia had to go to
 war with the Netherworld?"
#
<sprite "ta15a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0131">
"Celestia was originally part of the
 Netherworld."
#
<sprite "ta15a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0132">
"Celestia was created by dividing part of the
 Netherworld and moving it into another world."
#
<sprite "ta15a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0133">
"For those in the Netherworld, Celestia is a
 part of their land, so they believe it belongs
 to them."
#
<sprite "ta15a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0134">
"For those in Celestia, Celestia is the land
 that they took themselves, and they won't
 hand control of it to anybody."
#
<sprite "ta15a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0135">
"Well, that's the root cause of the conflict
 between Celestia and the Netherworld."
#
<sprite "ta15a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0136">
"By the way, that's an ancient story that's 
 been handed down for centuries that Celestia
 was part of it.
 Only the truly old know if it's true."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<sprite "ta15a020.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0137">
"Okay, the end."
