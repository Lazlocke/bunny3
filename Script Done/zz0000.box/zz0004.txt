"I didn't get to do much."

<name "Golan" "!CA0051" "ka32a000.agf">
"Not much."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0090" "ka33a000.agf">
"I've been here since the first game, but I
 hardly get to do anything."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0052" "ka32a000.agf">
"Hardly anything."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0091" "ka33a000.agf">
"I've been a regular since the first game,
 but because I'm a man, I get less and less
 focus! 
 Isn't that a problem!?"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0053" "ka32a000.agf">
"It is a problem!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0054" "ka32a000.agf">
"But calm down!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0055" "ka32a000.agf">
"It's a porn game, so of course the women will
 be given priority over us!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0056" "ka32a000.agf">
"Considering that every named adventurer has
 disappeared, we should be glad that we still
 get to appear at all and are still characters
 in the game!"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0092" "ka33a000.agf">
"T-That's true..."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0057" "ka32a000.agf">
"It wasn't just Dorothy, even Shia didn't get
 to appear in this game."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0093" "ka33a000.agf">
"Oooh..."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0058" "ka32a000.agf">
"It's better to show up at all."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0094" "ka33a000.agf">
"B-But I don't want to just settle for the
 status quo..."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0095" "ka33a000.agf">
"Yeah! We can't just take it easy!
 If we did, then we'd be like comedians who are
 happy just to be called out to fill time!"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0097" "ka33a000.agf">
"Forward!"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0098" "ka33a000.agf">
"Yes! We need to step forward!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0059" "ka32a000.agf">
"...There was that scene of rescuing Darx.
 We could've fit in there."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0099" "ka33a000.agf">
"Yeah, you're right!
 Marialis took it, but that should've been us!"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0060" "ka32a000.agf">
"Let's try it!"
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0100" "ka33a000.agf">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0101" "ka33a000.agf">
"Uh, can we just redo that scene again?"
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0061" "ka32a000.agf">
"We will protect you with our lives."
#
<name "Darx">
"I understand the feeling but... go home."
