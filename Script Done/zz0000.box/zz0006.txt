"Okay, complaining time."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0273">
"That's out of nowhere."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0196">
"Well, just listen."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0274">
"What?"
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0197">
"Let's sleep together.
 What would you think about a big or little 
 sister who said that to you?"
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0275">
"Hahahahaha.
 Complete fantasy."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0198">
"That's what I'd expect of someone who actually
 has a sister."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0276">
"To sisters, brothers are just errand boys."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0199">
"That's depressing."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0277">
"So, where'd this come from?
 Just want to tease me over my trauma?"
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0200">
"No, no, that's not it.
 Actually, there's a harem novel with lines
 just like that."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0278">
"Oh, like being seduced by a sister?"
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0201">
"That's right.
 I read it, and it made me angry."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0281">
"Angry? It's just a book.
 Reality is real life.
 Shouldn't we keep them separated?"
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0282">
"I wouldn't mind having a nice older or younger
 sister."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0202">
"That's true.
 That's not what I'm mad about."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0283">
"Uh...
 Then what got you mad?"
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0203">
"That they'd go after him so much, and the
 protagonist wouldn't touch them!"
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0284">
".........I see.
 I understand that."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0285">
"So that's what you're trying to say."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0286">
"That kind of gentle sister doesn't exist...
 Basically, you're mad at the protagonist who
 had an angel throwing herself at him, but 
 didn't notice or care."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0204">
"Yes!
 If it were me, I would've been on them in two
 seconds!"
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0287">
"I-It's good to make quick decisions, but think
 about it.
 No matter how nice they are, that'd be your
 sister."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0288">
"Your family."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0205">
"Don't worry.
 After you've gone all the way with her, you'll
 find out she was a stepsister."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0289">
"This is getting dangerous...
 Okay, I'll go see your sister later.
 Oh, the real one of course."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0206">
"Stop that!
 Please no!"
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0290">
"Okay, snapped out of it now?"
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0207">
"I-I'm back.
 I'm okay now."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0291">
"There, there.
 Have a drink and calm down."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0208">
"Y-Yeah."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0209">
"Whew... Sorry."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0292">
"Don't run away to novels just because reality
 is painful."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0210">
"Yeah, I know that."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0293">
"By the way..."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0211">
"What?"
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0294">
"Aren't you getting married?"
 I've heard rumors."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0212">
"Yeah.
 Luckily."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0295">
"So that got me thinking."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0213">
"About what?"
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0296">
"Your spouse.
 To you, she's just a woman, but to their
 siblings, that's their sister."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0214">
"........."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0297">
"She's their sister, right?"
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0215">
"Are you trying to sabotage my wedding?
 I bet you are!
 That must be it!"
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0298">
"Hahahaha.
 Of course not.
 Invite me, and I'll be there to celebrate it."
#
<name "Listening Citizen" "!ZE0299">
"A long and happy life for you with someone
 else's sister."
#
<name "Talking Citizen" "!UA0216">
"Y-You bastard!"
#
Such was a scene at the bar.
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0104" "ka33a000.agf">
"Um, I think there really are genuinely nice
 sisters in real life."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0065" "ka32a000.agf">
"I-I'm in the group that can't believe that."
