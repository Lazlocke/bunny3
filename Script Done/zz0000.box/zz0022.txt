"We mainly heal with magic, and doctors aren't
 common, so treatment team is fine."
#
<name "Wondering Maid" "!DC0514">
"Is it important to have a doctor?"
#
<name "Healer Maid" "!PC0574">
"I'd be concerned about calling someone a
 medical doctor.
 But a magical healing team is a little hard
 to easily understand."
#
<name "Wondering Maid" "!DC0515">
"I see.
 Then there's no helping it."
#
<name "Healer Maid" "!PC0575">
"Yep. No helping it."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
So the correct answer is healing team!
