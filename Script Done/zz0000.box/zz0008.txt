"In the east, I hear there was a warlord who
 escaped his predicament by offering to die."

<name "Darx">
"I don't understand how that got him out of
 it."

"Is it because he apologized and offered his
 life?"
#
<name "Darx">
"I am sorry.
 Do whatever you want with my life.
 Like that?
 I would've killed him."

"Hahaha.
 That does seem like you."

"You have to observe the other person and get
 the timing just right. When they can't really
 kill you, but before they have to.
 Something like that."

"I see."

"Still, when someone in the east wants to take
 responsibility, don't they cut their stomach?
 Do easterners really feel no pain in their
 stomachs?"
#
<sprite "ta01a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1036">
"No, they do.
 It's quite painful, obviously.
 That's why it's called suicide."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."

 I'm not cutting my stomach, and I'm not
 preparing to die."
