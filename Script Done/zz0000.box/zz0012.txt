90 seconds later...

"Too bad!
 That was wrong!"

"Noooo! How could this happen!?"

"Actually, there's a reason she got it wrong."

"Okay, stop."

"What do you think about this?"
#
<name "Honest Audience" "!HC0201">
"People are going to be mad cutting to a 
 commerical after the countdown."
#
<name "Annoyed Audience" "!ZD0178">
"It I could, I would've smashed the TV."
#
<name "Calm Audience" "!UA0217">
"I'd change the channel out of anger, not stay
 around for the right answer."
#
<name "Housewife Audience" "!SB0268">
"I never have a good impression of those ads.
 I know it's the TV station's fault though..."
#
<name "Confused Audience" "!RB0178">
"I can let it pass if it happens once in a
 while, but it happens so much."
#
<name "Angry Audience" "!ZE0300">
"If they did that on a news show, I'd stop
 watching entirely."
#
<name "Boss" "!KB0299">
"Thank you for your feedback."
#
<name "Boss" "!KB0300">
"This is called stringing people along.
 Even though viewers hate it, it keeps being
 used extensively."
#
<name "Calm Audience" "!UA0218">
"It's better than it used to be though."
#
<name "Boss" "!KB0301">
"Because even if they don't like it, it works!
 A commercial that gives a bad impression is
 a hundred times better than giving no
 impression at all."

#
<name "Housewife Audience" "!SB0269">
"That's true..."
#
<name "Boss" "!KB0303">
"Also, don't forget.
 TV stations make shows to get people to watch
 ads. The ads are more important than the
 shows."
#
<name "Agreeing Audience" "!LB0192">
"T-That's right."
#
<name "Boss" "!KB0304">
"Stringing people along was invented to show
 more commercials."
#
<name "Extreme Audience" "!ZF0153">
"Rrr..."
#
<name "Boss" "!KB0305">
"So what can we do about that!?"
#
<name "Boss" "!KB0306">
"Heheheh...
 I've got a plan!"
#
<name "Excited Audience" "!JA0174">
"Oooh!"
#
<name "Extreme Audience" "!ZF0154">
"Let's hear your idea!"
#
<name "Narrator" "!MB0169">
"In 90 seconds!"
#
<name "Excited Audience" "!JA0175">
"Hey!!!!"
#
<name "Extreme Audience" "!ZF0155">
"Smash the screen!"
#
<name "Calm Audience" "!UA0219">
"W-Wait. It's just 90 seconds.
 Even if you rewind a little, that'd only be
 120 seconds.
 Let's be patient!"
#
<name "Angry Audience" "!ZE0301">
"Y-Yeah."

 Will our big guest be shocked too?
 Stay tuned!"

"Yeah."

"Stop! Hey! I'm sorry!
 I don't have any ideas!
 Stop!
 Please stop hitting me!"
#
I wonder if there's anything that we can do
about this kind of ad nonsense.
