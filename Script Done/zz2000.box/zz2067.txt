"Ao, Tamaga, got a minute?"

<sprite "ta17a000.agf" 6 4 11>
<name "Ao" "!WA0090">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Darx">
"I want to know why you attacked the city."
#
<sprite "ta19a001.agf" 2 5 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0091">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Darx">
"You attacked here, right?
 I want the reason why."
#
<sprite "ta19a000.agf" 2 5 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0092">
"Um, it's kind of a long story, I guess?"
#
<name "Darx">
"That's fine."
#
<sprite "ta19a003.agf" 2 5 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0093">
"Then I'll tell you.
 Tamaga, jump in if you have anything to add
 or I make a mistake."

"Okay."

"First off, it all started right before the
 castle fell."
#
<sprite "ta19a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0095">
"We were warned to run away before it fell."
#
<sprite "ta19a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0096">
"Nobody controlled the area, but it was a
 genuine warning.
 All of us who lived around that area took
 shelter."
#
<sprite "ta19a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0097">
"Then the castle fell just like they said.
 Everywhere was wrecked."
#
<sprite "ta19a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0098">
"And just when we thought it was over, another
 castle came along, and then another and
 another. After running away to the edges,
 we couldn't get back to our homes."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<sprite "ta19a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0099">
"After a while, we got a message from the
 Netherworld that things had calmed down and
 it was safe to go back."

"I heard around then that there was going to
 be an attempt to take control of that area."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I left dealing with that area up the Meryl.
#
Maybe it's okay to tell them that.
#
<sprite "ta19a001.agf" 4 4 11>

"Some of the smaller groups joined peacefully,
 but most of them refused to submit."
#
<sprite "ta19a000.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0101">
"It'd been hundreds of years outside of
 Forzelotte's control. Every group was like
 their own kingdom.
 They wouldn't just give that up."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hmm."
#
<sprite "ta19a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0102">
"And when we tried to go back home, we couldn't
 because angels were spreading out from the
 fallen castles."

"Of course, that led to battle."

<name "Ao" "!WA0104">
"Yeah. For some reason, they mercilessly
 targeted the men."
#
<sprite "ta19a010.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0105">
"Because of that, Tamaga and I became leaders.
 Same with the other groups."

<name "Ao" "!WA0106">
"We kept fighting, but things were only getting
 worse.
 So we formed an alliance."

"Better than falling apart."

<sprite "ta19a000.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0107">
"Yeah.
 Actually, it worked too."

"We outnumbered them."

"And we started actually being able to fight
 back, but when we were trying to get back to
 our original homes..."

"Forzelotte set up a city on the south side
 where there hadn't been as much damage."

"Forzelotte did?"

"Yeah. Our information then was bad.
 You had already become Overlord, but we
 thought she still was."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 So you attacked the city?"

"Yes, but..."

<sprite "ta19a011.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0112">
"At the time, um..."
#

"What is it?
 Be clear."
#
<sprite "ta19a010.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0113">
"The castle falling and angels attacking us...
 There were rumors that it was all a plot to
 make this city."

"..."

<name "Ao" "!WA0114">
"I'm not dumb enough to believe a rumor like
 that, but I looked into the information, and
 apparently whoever knocked down the castle
 is in this city."

"If we didn't attack the city, we wouldn't 
 just not have an alliance, we wouldn't be
 able to keep what we had together."

"I see.
 So that's why you attacked."

<removesprite 6 11>

"Okay.
 I understand better.
 Thank you."

"It's nothing."

"Overlord."

"Hm?"

<sprite "ta17a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Tamaga" "!PB0091">
"Is it true the person who made the castle
 fall is in this city?"

"What? You really don't know?"

<name "Tamaga" "!PB0092">
"Huh?"

<name "Darx">
"It's me."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, but I didn't drop it for fun."
#
<name "Darx">
"That castle was about to engage in a very
 dangerous attack. If I hadn't dropped it,
 things would have ended up far worse."

<name "Ao" "!WA0117">
"O-Oh, really?"

"I wonder if that got twisted."

<sprite "ta19a010.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0118">
"...Yeah."
#
<name "Darx">
"It's the truth.
 If you want, you can ask others about it."
#
<sprite "ta19a009.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0119">
"No, I don't doubt you...
 But why did the information that we got get
 so confused?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta17a010.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Tamaga" "!PB0093">
"Right.
 I never heard anything like what you just
 told us."
#
<name "Darx">
"You think somebody been deliberating feeding
 you bad information?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta19a000.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Ao" "!WA0120">
"Yes."
#
<name "Darx">
"But who gains from that?"

<name "Ao" "!WA0121">
"You're right..."

<sprite "ta17a010.agf" 6 4 11>
<name "Tamaga" "!PB0095">
"If they can manipulate information that much,
 wouldn't it be better to work first on
 improving the relationships between the 
 groups?"
#
<sprite "ta19a010.agf" 2 5 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0122">
"Maybe we're overthinking it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, it's something to keep in mind."
#
<sprite "ta19a003.agf" 2 5 12>
<name "Ao" "!WA0123">
"Y-Yes."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
...
#
I agree with her, but something's still not
adding up.
#
If someone was manipulating information...
Who? And why?
#
I think it's safe to assume it's probably the
angels holed up in the castle...
#
I'm not sure we can figure this out yet.
#
Like I told them, we just need to stay on
guard.
