"Hm? What's up?"

<name "Raffino" "!EB0025">
"I just needed to talk for a second..."
#
<name "Darx">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Some problem with living in the city?"

<sprite "ta20a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Raffino" "!EB0026">
"No, they've taken good care of us."

"It's like we were never your enemies at all."

 Prove it with your actions."

"S-Sir.
 Excuse me."
#
<name "Darx">
"So, what did you want to talk about?
 If it's not living in the city, then..."

<name "Raffino" "!EB0029">
"It's about my people who haven't been set
 free yet."

When she came back with me, she convinced most
of the people around her to come with her.
#
But there were a few who couldn't be

"You want me to let them go?"

<sprite "ta20a002.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Raffino" "!EB0030">
"Please.
 They may not follow you, but I believe they'll
 be respectful citizens of the city."

<name "Raffino" "!EB0031">
"I think they're just being stubborn because
 of everything that's happened..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, I don't mind letting them go.
 It's not cheap to guard a prison anyway."

<name "Raffino" "!EB0032">
"Thank you very much."
#
<name "Darx">
"However, you will explain to them exactly
 what will happen to them if they harm the
 city or bare their fangs at me."
#
<sprite "ta20a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Raffino" "!EB0033">
"Understood."
#
<name "Darx">
"Go tell them.
 Tomorrow morning, they'll be set free."

<name "Raffino" "!EB0034">
"Yes, sir.
 Thank you very much."
