"Ah, you there, young lady.
 Don't freeze them and then grab them by
 hand."

<name "Announcing Citizen" "!BC0208">
"And you there, miss.
 No boiling the pond."

"Aah, you there, young lady.
 I see you are ready to dive, but swimming is
 against the rules during this tournament."
#
<name "Announcing Citizen" "!BC0211">
"I also see some of you ladies holding spears
 and bows. The only tools allowed in this
 tournament are rods, lines, hooks, and bait.
 Please put your weapons away."
