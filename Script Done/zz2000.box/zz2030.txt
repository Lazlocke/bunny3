"They're doing a lottery."
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0154">
"Yeah. If you collect ten tickets from 
 shopping in the city, you get one draw."
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0155">
"There's a full of of luxury prizes!
 And if you miss, you still get a 1Ｂ gift
 certificate you can use at the Overlord's
 Retreat."
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0156">
"There's no reason not to play."
#
<name "Expectant Citizens" "!ZE0256">
"So you get tickets just going through your
 regular life, huh?
 Okay, let's do this."
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0157">
"Wait!"
#
<name "Expectant Citizens" "!ZE0257">
"W-What?"
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0158">
"The way the draw works is by pulling a stone
 with a number on it from a box!"
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0159">
"Once the stone is drawn, they don't put it
 back in the box!"
#
<name "Expectant Citizens" "!ZE0258">
"Yeah, so if you don't draw soon enough,
 it'll be over."
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0161">
"Fool!
 If you don't let some of them be drawn,
 you'll be stuck with the worst odds for a
 big prize!"
#
<name "Expectant Citizens" "!ZE0259">
"Really?"
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0162">
"Think about it."
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0163">
"For example, let's say the odds of a prize
 are one in 100.
 After one miss, it becomes one in 99!
 After two, it's one in 98!"
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0164">
"It's better to draw after there have been
 some misses!
 Drawing early is the height of stupidity!"
#
<name "Expectant Citizens" "!ZE0260">
"Ooh! I see!
 You're so smart!"
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0165">
"Heheheh..."

"Oh, that's the third prize.
 Congratulations!"

"Lucky!"

"That's the second prize.
 Congratulations!"

"...Hey."
#

"Um..."

"Hey."
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0167">
"Um..."
#
<name "Expectant Citizens" "!ZE0263">
"I want to draw right now!"
#
<name "Calculating Citizen" "!JA0168">
"Huh? Oh! M-Me too!"
#
Both of them lost.
