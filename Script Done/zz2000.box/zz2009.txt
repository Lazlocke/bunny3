"This puzzle is really hard."
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5020">
"What puzzle?"
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5025">
"This one.
 If I could just solve it, I could move on..."
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5021">
"Hmmmm.
 That's pretty complicated.
 Wait, why are you doing this while you're on
 duty?"
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5026">
"I'm bored.
 No intruders ever come somewhere like this."
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5022">
"...Well, that's true."
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5027">
"So, this puzzle...
 Do you get it?"
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5023">
"How should I know?
 I mean, it's a puzzle to drive off 
 intruders."
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5024">
"Or rather...
 I think the problem here is that you've 
 already unlocked two of the seven parts of
 the puzzle."
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5028">
"I'll reset them later."
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5025">
"Geez..."
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5029">
"Still... this is tough.
 Maybe the ball here is a hint."
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5026">
"If you're worried about the answer, why don't
 you ask dungeon master?"
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5030">
"Hmm...
 Is that the only way?"
#
<name "Adventurer" "!KB5019">
"Hold it right there!"
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5031">
"W-Who's there?"
#
<name "Adventurer" "!KB5020">
"I am the rival of Whitney the Baker!
 Heiselman the Dumpling Maker!"
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5027">
"...I-Intruder!"
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5032">
"R-Ring the alarm!
 Call reinforcements!"
#
<name "Heiselman" "!KB5021">
"Wait!
 Hold on!
 I have no intention of attacking you!"
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5033">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Heiselman" "!KB5022">
"If I did, I would have cut you down without
 calling out to you."
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5034">
"That's true..."
#
<name "Heiselman" "!KB5023">
"My adventurer style is to avoid combat as
 much as possible and to sneakily steal the
 treasures of a dungeon, all on my own!"
#
<name "Heiselman" "!KB5025">
"I appeared before you!
 Do you know why!?"
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5028">
"U-Um..."
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5035">
"You mean, to solve this puzzle?"
#
<name "Heiselman" "!KB5026">
"Yes!"
#
<name "Heiselman" "!KB5027">
"Whitney the Baker is my rival.
 An unsolvable puzzle is a challenge to me!
 I must face this challenge!"
#
<name "Defending Demon" "!RB5036">
"T-Then, do you want to try to solve it?
 It seems impossible for us."
#
<name "Heiselman" "!KB5028">
"Let me at it!"
#
<name "Guard Demon" "!LB5029">
"I-Is this okay?"

"I thought so."

"But I feel so refreshed with it solved!"
