"It's the first ever tournament for Dragon
 Slayer, the sport of hitting a ball with
 sticks."

<name "Announcer Maid" "!PC0438" "ka34d000.agf">
"The first match is Diamond Punch versus
 The Overlords."
#
<name "Announcer Maid" "!PC0439" "ka34d000.agf">
"Diamond Punch's top four batters are master
 class. We can expect high scoring from them."
#
<name "Commenting Maid" "!DC0318" "ka34e000.agf">
"On the other side, The Overlords are a team
 based around the Overlord.
 Most of its members are dirty players.
 The only wild card is the Overlord himself."

<name "Commenting Maid" "!DC0319" "ka34e000.agf">
"I hear that he's developed a new trick
 pitch."
#
<name "Commenting Maid" "!DC0320" "ka34e000.agf">
"Will that trick pitch be able to hold back
 Diamond Punch?
 Look forward to the big game."

"The Overlord couldn't do it.
 I didn't expect him to be pulled in the
 second inning."

<name "Announcer Maid" "!PC0441" "ka34d000.agf">
"After that, Tojo held off Diamond Punch with
 an impressive pitching performance, but the
 deficit the Overlord left was too much to
 overcome."
#
<name "Commenting Maid" "!DC0321" "ka34e000.agf">
"Yes. The final results were 18-12 for
 Diamond Punch.
 Well played, both teams."

"Now, on to the next game."
