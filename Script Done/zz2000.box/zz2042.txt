"First, when they're not pregnant."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0129">
"During this time, the breast milk has an
 aphrodisiac effect in order to attract a male.
 The taste is rich and viscous.
 It sells quite well."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0130">
"Next, when they're pregnant."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0131">
"Since the nutrients are going to the child
 inside her, the taste of the breast milk is
 diminished."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0132">
"However, it is also a raw material for some
 drugs, so it can be sold, but not for a lot."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0133">
"Finally, from after they give birth until 
 around six months later."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0134">
"This is breast milk for the child."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0135">
"Of course, since it's for a child, it is 
 packed with nutrients."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0136">
"This fetches the highest price, but since it's
 for their baby, it's not easy to come by."

"The end.
 That's all you need to know about angolamay
 breast milk."
