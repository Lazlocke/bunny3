"Brenda!"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0091">
"Frenda."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0086">
"G-Glenda."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0101">
"It's the standup comedy corner trio!"
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0102">
"Well, doing standup out of nowhere somewhere
 like this?
 It's kinda hard."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0087">
"I know, right?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0092">
"I have no problem with it.
 I'm always ready for anything.
 I'm not like you."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0088">
"Huh?
 You're ready even for doing standup?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0093">
"Of course."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0089">
"W-Wow."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0094">
"But you can't do standup alone.
 I'm ready, but you guys..."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0103">
"Hold on a minute.
 How exactly are you ready?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0095">
"I have a big folded paper, stretchy slacks,
 and tools for hanging up laundry."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0104">
"Um... Hold on.
 First of all..."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0105">
"You don't use props for standup!
 Standup is won or lost only through the
 dialogue!"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0090">
"If you use props or set pieces, then it
 becomes sketch comedy."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0106">
"Second, these props are terrible!
 What is this?
 How are you supposed to use it?"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0091">
"You never had any intention of doing this
 with the stuff you brought."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0107">
"And what, you always carry stuff like this
 around with you?"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0092">
"I had thought it was strange for you to have
 it for a while."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0096">
"You better not be underestimating me.
 I brought these props so that you rookies
 could make fun of them. Did you really think
 that was all I had ready?"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0093">
"Huh?
 There's more?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0099">
"I don't just have these props, but I have
 gags too."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0108">
"Ooh!
 You have a whole notebook full of jokes!"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0100">
"Heheheh.
 So how about we talk about the weather?
 I'll start, and you can just read from
 there."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0094">
"N-Now you feel like a veteran."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0109">
"So let's talk about the weather.
 Um...
 It's been hot lately."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0101">
"It has."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0095">
"When it's this hot, it's hard to sleep at
 night."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0102">
"It is."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0110">
"That's right.
 And when you wake up in the morning, you're
 covered in sweat.
 But because it's hot, it dries up quickly."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0103">
"It does."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0096">
"That just leaves the awful smell.
 Man, I hope it gets cold soon."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0104">
"It will."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0111">
"Hey, you're just agreeing with everything!"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0105">
"I am."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0097">
"Ah! There's nothing written in this notebook
 but things like 'It is' and 'What the heck'!"
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0112">
"You thought you were going to get away with
 just that!?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0106">
"Don't worry, it'll work."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0113">
"No it won't!
 Geez! I've had enough!"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0098">
"Thank you very much."
#
...
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0114">
"So, h-how was that?"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0099">
"For our punishment for slacking off."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0107">
"We tried our best."
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA0069">
"Judge, your decision?"
#
<name "Darx">
"It was kind of funny, so one more round."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0115">
"Awwwww..."
