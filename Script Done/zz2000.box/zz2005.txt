"Hello."
#
<name "Veteran Guard" "!TC0115" "ka35b000.agf">
"Ah, Subcommander Filliane."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0002" "ka25a000.agf">
"I'm not in the guard anymore.
 I'm not your subcommander."
#
<name "Veteran Guard" "!TC0116" "ka35b000.agf">
"I guess.
 Head of childcare then."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0003" "ka25a000.agf">
"There is that...
 Hahaha..."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0004" "ka25a000.agf">
"I never expected that I'd have a talent for
 taking care of kids."
#
<name "Veteran Guard" "!TC0117" "ka35b000.agf">
"But you're famous for it now."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0005" "ka25a000.agf">
"I guess.
 Um, where's Mari?"
#
<name "Veteran Guard" "!TC0118" "ka35b000.agf">
"The captain should be back soon.
 Please be patient."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0006" "ka25a000.agf">
"Okay."
#
<name "Darx">
"I could keep you company in the meantime."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0007" "ka25a000.agf">
"Overlord!
 It's been a while."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah.
 ...Are you okay?
 You look like you're not eating enough."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0008" "ka25a000.agf">
"Thank you for your concern.
 If anything, I'm putting on weight..."
#
<name "Darx">
"I have heard that kids are a lot of hard
 labor."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0009" "ka25a000.agf">
"Yes, but it's much more fun than being on the
 battlefield."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 ...Sorry for leaving you to take care of all
 the kids."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0010" "ka25a000.agf">
"It's fine.
 I have a daughter of my own too."
#
<name "Darx">
"How is Fina doing?
 She's not jealous of her mother getting taken
 away?"
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0011" "ka25a000.agf">
"She's well.
 Not exactly jealous... more like lonely.
 She is getting along with Maria though."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, Fina and Maria are close, aren't they?"
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0012" "ka25a000.agf">
"They're already good friends, just like Mari
 and me."
#
<sprite "ta15a003.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0084">
"But if you keep him all to yourself, there
 might be cracks in that relationship."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0013" "ka25a000.agf">
"Aah!
 You scared me."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<name "Darx">
"Welcome back."
#
<sprite "ta15a003.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0085">
"Sir.
 Reporting back from duty.
 I'm ready to report..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<name "Darx">
"Make it quick and I'll let you go."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0014" "ka25a000.agf">
"It'd be okay for it to be just the three of
 us in bed."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hahaha.
 Unfortunately not an option today."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0015" "ka25a000.agf">
"Too bad."
#
<name "Darx">
"Seriously."
