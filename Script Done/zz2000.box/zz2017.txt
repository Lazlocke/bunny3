"Come on, I'm always having to tell you to
 clean up your room."

<name "Childish Citizen" "!BC0176">
"Shut up.
 I'll do it later."
#
<name "Motherly Citizen" "!GB0266">
"When's later?
 Don't tell me you won't do it except during
 cleaning festivals."
#
<name "Childish Citizen" "!BC0177">
"Yeah, that's right.
 I'll clean it up when it's cleaning festival
 time."

<name "Motherly Citizen" "!GB0267">
"...So you'll do it if it's a cleaning
 festival?"
#
<name "Childish Citizen" "!BC0178">
"Yeah. I'll do it.
 Good enough then?"
#
<name "Motherly Citizen" "!GB0268">
"If you don't, that'd be bad, right?"

 Why do you have all those cleaning supplies?"
#
<name "Motherly Citizen" "!GB0270">
"Because today is a cleaning festival."
#
<name "Childish Citizen" "!BC0180">
"Y-You set me up!"
#
<name "Motherly Citizen" "!GB0271">
"If the Overlord saw this, you know you'd be
 in trouble."
#
<name "Childish Citizen" "!BC0181">
"U-Urgh...
 Fine, whatever."
#
The city was cleaned up, and the citizens
were motivated.
#
<name "Motherly Citizen" "!GB0272">
"Every week, if we can!
 Please, every single week!"
