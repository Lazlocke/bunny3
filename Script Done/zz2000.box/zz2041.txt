"A trial of strength?
 What's that?"

"What? Isn't it what it sounds like?
 It's the next event they're holding."

<name "Demon Citizen" "!KB5002">
"I understand that much.
 This is what I don't get.
 Read the part of the announcement here."

"No race restrictions."

"What do you think?"
#
<name "Ordinary Citizen" "!ZD5008">
"What the hell?"
#
<name "Demon Citizen" "!KB5004">
"Right?"
#
<name "Ordinary Citizen" "!ZD5009">
"Yeah.
 What's going on?
 How do you compare the strength of something
 like a giant and a fairy without a handicap?"

 We were able to attract an audience, but
