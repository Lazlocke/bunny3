"A gambling tournament?
 What's that?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0543">
"Literally, a tournament of gambling."
#
<name "Interested Citizen" "!KB0289">
"I still don't get it."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0545">
"Every participant is a player who gambles
 in contests determined by the tournament
 over a period of time.
 Whoever wins the most money is the winner."
#
<name "Interested Citizen" "!KB0290">
"I see."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0546">
"There's no entry fee, but you need to put up
 your own money to gamble.
 So you also get to keep whatever you win."
#
<name "Interested Citizen" "!KB0291">
"Oh?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0547">
"There's one catch.
 You're judged on how much money you win
 through gambling."
#
<name "Interested Citizen" "!KB0292">
"Meaning..."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0548">
"It doesn't matter if you start with a
 million Ｂ.
 If you don't earn a single Ｂ through 
 gambling, you can't win."
#
<name "Interested Citizen" "!KB0293">
"I get it.
 Still though, doesn't starting with a ton of
 money give you a big advantange?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0549">
"But you also risk losing it all in a bad
 bet."
#
<name "Interested Citizen" "!KB0294">
"I see."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0550">
"Participating is free, so please join if you
 have a chance."
#
<name "Interested Citizen" "!KB0295">
"I'll think about it."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0551">
"Thank you very much."
#

#

"Well, it seems like people had a good time."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0552">
"The problem was the last day got a little
 too heated up."
#
<name "Darx">
"You fanned the flames too much.
 You don't need to make a profit off of
 running everything.
 Think about that carefully."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0553">
"Y-Yes, sir.
 Next time will be milder."
