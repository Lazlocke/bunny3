"Brenda and Frenda... 
 Your names are confusing because they're so
 similar."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0087">
"You're saying that now?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0078">
"Hasn't it been a pretty long time since we
 met each other?"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0079">
"Yeah, but... I still think about it.
 It's not like you're sisters."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0088">
"There's a lot of people out there, so some
 people just have similar names."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0079">
"That's right."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0080">
"But similar names, similar circumstances,
 both squad leaders in the same unit."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0081">
"Isn't that confusing?"
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0089">
"It's not confusing.
 Nobody's gotten it wrong yet, have they?"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0082">
"I guess, but, um..."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0080">
"Then why don't we don't try making your name
 like it too?"
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0083">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0081">
"Brenda, Frenda, and... 
 How about Glenda?"
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0090">
"Brenda, Frenda, Glenda."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0091">
"I think our subordinates might have an issue
 with that."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0084">
"See? It is confusing."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0082">
"It's because there's three.
 Two is fine."
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA0068">
"Yes, yes.
 No chitchat while on the job.
 Brenda, Frenda, Glenda.
 Are there any issues?"
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0092">
"N-None."
#
<name "Mylene" "!TC0085">
"N-None, but please back to Mylene."
