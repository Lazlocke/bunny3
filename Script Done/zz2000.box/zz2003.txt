"Frenda, have you decided what you're going
 to do for the next talent show?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0083">
"That's a secret."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0094">
"If it's a secret, that means you've already
 got something!"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0084">
"Ooh... I let it slip in my haste.
 It was pointless keeping it secret."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0095">
"That's right. No point in it.
 So tell me what you're going to do."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0085">
"The helping hands act."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0096">
"...What's that?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0086">
"I learned it from a dragon who came from the
 east.
 I bet it'll be pretty popular."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0097">
"Can I do it too?"
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0087">
"You could, but...
 A talent show is a competition, and we're
 enemies."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0098">
"I-I guess..."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0088">
"There's still time until it.
 Think hard to come up with your own act.
 Oh, maybe you could try asking some human
 adventurers for something."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0089">
"They know a lot of things that'd be good for
 a secret talent."
#
<name "Brenda" "!QB0099">
"That'd be good.
 It's a nice idea, but I wonder if they'd
 honestly tell me."
#
<name "Frenda" "!WB0090">
"Hmm... Then..."
#
For a while, there were rumors about a 
strange fallen angel in the Forest of the
Overlord who would let you get away if you
could show her an unusual trick.
