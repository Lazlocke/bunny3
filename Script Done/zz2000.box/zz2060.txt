"Hibi? Are you doing okay?"
#
<name "Hibi" "!DB0028" "ka23a000.agf">
"I guess... more or less..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Are you getting used to living in the city?"
#
<name "Hibi" "!DB0029" "ka23a001.agf">
"Yes..."
#
The people who were following her also moved
to the city thanks to her.
#
She was apparently very convincing, and nobody
resisted.
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 Well, if there are any problems, let me know."
#
<name "Hibi" "!DB0030" "ka23a000.agf">
"Then..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Hibi" "!DB0031" "ka23a001.agf">
"Um..."
#
I can guess what she's after.
#
<name "Darx">
"Front or back?"
#
<name "Hibi" "!DB0032" "ka23a100.agf">
"...B-Back."
#
<name "Darx">
"Got it.
 Both."
#
<name "Hibi" "!DB0033" "ka23a111.agf">
"Huh? Ah...
 T-That's not..."
#
I enjoy her body.
#
Hibi is one of us now.
