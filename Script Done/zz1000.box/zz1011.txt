<name "Miartei" "!SA0289">
"Aah! Mm! Ah! Aahh!
 Ah! Aaah! Mm! Mmm!"
#
With my dick inside her, she winds her hips
skillfully and stimulates me.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0290">
"Ah! Aah! Ah! Mmm! Mmm!
 Ahhh! Aaah! Mmmm!"
#
I leave it all to her, admiring her
enthusiasm.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0103">
"Ah...aah...
 I-I can... aahh...aah...mmm...aah...
 feel... feel you... ah... ah... moving..."
#
She moves her hips even harder and rubs the
upper half of her body against me.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0104">
"Ah...ah...mmm...ahhh...ah...ah..."
#
She gets more intense until she suddenly
freezes.
#
<background "ev022a01.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0105">
"Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!"
#
She orgasms at the same time as I come.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0106">
"Ah...aah...ah..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Miartei."
#
<background "ev022a02.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0107">
"Aah..."
#
I lean in close, and she comes to me and
kisses me.
#
But her eyes say she wants more.
#
Words, not actions.
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, you're better than Rualtei."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0108">
"Aaahhhh..."
#
Her smile covers her whole face.
#
The reason she's completely changed is because
I realized her weakness.
#
It's...
#
<background "ev021a02.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0109">
"Mm...mmm...aahh..."
#
<name "Darx">
"You've gotten used to the pleasure."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0110">
"Mm...mmm..."
#
She started refusing to even talk to me and
just lost herself in the act.
#
Even at the end, she didn't give in to me.
#
For a while, I relentlessly used her, but I
got bored of her and switched to Rualtei.
#
My dick loved coming in the pussy of a woman
who honestly enjoyed it and wanted it.
#
And that's when I said it.
#
<name "Darx">
"You're better than Miartei."
#
<background "ev022a02.agf" 10>
<name "Darx">
"Again."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0111">
"Okay."
#
After that, Miartei started trying to get my
attention.
#
She even said that she'd abandon Celestia and
swear herself to me.
#
It's like all her previous hatred was a lie.
I thought it might be a trap, but I was 
worried about nothing.
#
She truly didn't want to be inferior to her
sister.
#
All of it is just about that.
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, that reminds me.
 That kiss...
 Rualtei is a..."
#
She kisses me before I can even finish the
sentence.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0112">
"Ah...ahh...mmm...mmmmmmm!"
#
A passionate kiss.
#
<name "Darx">
"Not bad..."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0113">
"Ah..."
#
The way she acts always makes me think of
Rualtei.
#
And I realized something.
#
Her potential.
#
Right now, Miartei is probably better, but
who knows what the future may bring.
#
But Miartei is convinced of it.
#
That Rualtei will one day surpass her.
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
I grab Miartei's hips and stop her.
#
<background "ev022a03.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0114">
"...W-What is it?"
#
Rualtei has her charm, but so do you.
#
I know you don't want to lose to your little
sister, but you're not in competition.
#
...
#
She wouldn't listen if I told her.
#
No, she wouldn't accept it.
#
She needs time.
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, sorry.
 Keep going."
#
<background "ev022a04.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0115">
"Y-Yes.
 Leave it to me."
#
A few days later, Miartei was bowing to me in
front of my throne.
