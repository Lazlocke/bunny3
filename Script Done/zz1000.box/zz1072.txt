"Human captives?"

<name "Company Maid" "!AC0226">
"Yes."
#
<name "Darx">
"I don't remember telling you to take 
 prisoners."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
The opposite.
I remember ordering them to not take 
prisoners.
#
If this was Forzelotte's Shrine, we'd have 
room and people to manage that, but we barely
have enough people here to stand guard as it
is.
#
Also, it takes time and effort to negotiate
their release.
#
There's no room for prisoners in this city.

<sprite "ta34c001.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0227">
"I'm very sorry."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0228">
"We do have a prison, so we throw adventurers
 in it who have gotten too destructive to
 punish them, and we let them out after two
 or three days."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0229">
"However, um..."
#
<sprite "ta34c002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0230">
"There's an adventurer who's gotten too
 troublesome even for that, and those who
 work in the dungeon strongly oppose 
 releasing them."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0231">
"We can't ignore that, so I came to you."
#
<name "Darx">
"By coming to me, you mean..."
#
<sprite "ta34c000.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0232">
"It's a woman."

"Aah...ah..."
#
Since she was already tied up and naked, I
forcibly took her virginity and then had 
about three more rounds of fun.
#
<name "Darx">
"Remember this.
 Your first man was me."
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0117">
"Ah...ah...
 I-I'll kill you."
#
<name "Darx">
"That's a nice glare, but..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Not nearly crazy enough."
#
The angels were far scarier.
#
For every single one of them, it felt like
they'd kill me the moment I let my guard
down.
#
But I don't feel that from this woman.
#
I took her virginity and fucked her three
more times after that.
#
If she was an angel, she would've tried to
bite me to death.
#
<name "Darx">
"Is this really the woman who's so much
 trouble?"
#
She just seems like a regular warrior.
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0233">
"There's no doubt about it."
#
The maid waiting behind me answers.
#
<name "Darx">
"And yet..."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0234">
"Apparently she completely changes when she
 has her sword."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see..."
#
<name "Darx">
"You, are you aware of this?
 Answer me."
#
<background "ev081a01.agf" 10>
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0118">
"..."
#
<name "Darx">
"You want me to fuck you again?
 I don't mind."
#
<background "ev081a02.agf" 10>
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0119">
"W-When I hold a sword, I-I feel stronger
 than anything."
#
<name "Darx">
"Any kind of sword?"
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0120">
"I've never had anything but my sword."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
I try holding up a regular sword in front of
her.
#
<name "Darx">
"How's this?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Do you hate me?"
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0121">
"O-Of course I do."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Nothing."
#
It's the same as before.
#
<name "Darx">
"Bring me her sword."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0235">
"B-But..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Do it."
#
...
#
<background "ev081b00.agf" 10>
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0122">
"Ah!"
#
As soon as I hold up her sword, the look in
her eyes completely changes.
#
<background "ev081b01.agf" 10>
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0123">
"Give it!
 Give me that sword!"
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0124">
"And I will slice you to shreds!"
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0125">
"Ahahahahahahaha!!!!!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Hmm..."
#
Definitely an immediate change.
#
<name "Darx">
"Sorry."
#
<background "ev081c00.agf" 10>
After apologizing, I slam the sword on the 
ground, breaking it.
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0126">
"Ah..."
#
<name "Darx">
"How's that?"
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0127">
"Huh?
 Ah... huh?"
#
<name "Darx">
"How do you feel?"
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0128">
"I... I-I feel strange..."
#
<name "Darx">
"That was a cursed sword.
 They're well-known among adventurers."
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0129">
"It was?"
#
<name "Darx">
"I'll give you some kind of new sword."
#
<name "Darx">
"So call it even."
#
<background "ev081d00.agf" 10>
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0130">
"Huh? Oh, o-okay."
#
<name "Darx">
"Then, shall we continue?"
#
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0131">
"Huh?"
#
I enjoyed her for another half day.
#
<background "ev081d01.agf" 10>
<name "Berserker Adventurer" "!LB0132">
"I-I-I swear I'll kill you!"
#
<name "Darx">
"I'm looking forward to it."
