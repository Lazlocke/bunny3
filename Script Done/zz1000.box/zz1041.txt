"Hmm.
 So you're Darx.
 You did well to make it here."
#
<name "Darx">
"Who are you?"

<sprite "ta07a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Mysterious Voice" "!MA0016">
"My name is Wadatsumi."

<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0017">
"I am your enemy."
#
<name "Darx">
"So you're the one giving orders to Suisen?"
#
<sprite "ta07a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0018">
"That is correct."
#
<sprite "ta07a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0019">
"Apparently she told you my name, but her
 devotion to me is still admirable."

<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0020">
"She has bought me considerable time.
 I must be grateful.
 Mmhmm."

"You seem confident standing here before me."

<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0021">
"Confident?
 You mean my attitude?"
#
<sprite "ta07a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0022">
"I had to sacrifice a considerable amount of
 strength to come to the human world, and
 you see this as confidence?"

<name "Darx">
"It doesn't seem like you're up against the
 wall."

<sprite "ta07a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0023">
"That is the wisdom that comes with age."

"If you live long enough, you will learn many
 things."
#
<sprite "ta07a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0025">
"And in all cases, you must have a plan, and
 you must stick to it."

"Now is no exception."

"Celestials joining with demons, living in a
 city together."
#
<sprite "ta07a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0028">
"It is outrageous."
#
<sprite "ta07a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0029">
"It is absurd."

"No, it is unacceptable."

"You know your neighbors are savages.
 How can you live in peace?"

"You cannot."
#
<sprite "ta07a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0033">
"And yet, creating such a city tricks the
 innocents of Celestia."

<sprite "ta07a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0034">
"Perhaps our neighbors are actually fine
 people."

<sprite "ta07a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0035">
"How foolish."
#
<sprite "ta07a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0036">
"For the foolish Celestials that I cherish,
 that city... must be erased."

"And me too?"

I can see my other body behind him.
#
And in the middle of it is Forzelotte.
#
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0038">
"This separate body is quite impressive."
#
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0039">
"If it was my son, I would pat its head and
 tell it that it had done well..."
#
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0040">
"But it's not a human."
#
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0041">
"A human having this much mana is something
 that cannot be allowed to exist."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 So after all this talk, there's nothing I
 can say?"
#
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0042">
"Mmm.
 I suppose I cannot ask you to just lay down
 and die."
#
<name "Darx">
"I suppose."
#
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0043">
"Then I'm not asking.
 Die."
