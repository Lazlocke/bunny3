"Control complete."

<name "Support Maid" "!DC0127" "ka34d000.agf">
"Congratulations.
 It's no exaggeration to say that you have
 completely conquered this place."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 All right."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0108" "ka34c000.agf">
"However, maybe there's a little more?
 Like riches, treasure, or money?"
#
<name "Support Maid" "!DC0128" "ka34d000.agf">
"You're too transparent."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0109" "ka34c000.agf">
"Hahaha..."
#
<name "Support Maid" "!DC0129" "ka34d000.agf">
"Still, there certainly is nothing.
 I feel bad after how hard you worked."
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't worry about it.
 That's just how things are."
#
<name "Support Maid" "!DC0130" "ka34d000.agf">
"No, no.
 Overlord, even if there's nothing here, you
 have us."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?
 Are you going to do something?"
#
<name "Support Maid" "!DC0131" "ka34d000.agf">
"Leave it to us."
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?"

"I knew you could do it, Overlord."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0110">
"You did it, Overlord."
#
<name "Battle Maid" "!PC0145">
"You're wonderful, Overlord."
#
<name "Support Maid" "!DC0133">
"Come on, drink up."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0111">
"Yay!"
#
<name "Darx">
"You guys just wanted to have a party..."
#
<name "Battle Maid" "!PC0146">
"Don't worry about it.
 Here's some naked women for you."
#
<name "Darx">
"You're probably thinking that if you give me
 women, you can get away with anything."
#
<name "Support Maid" "!DC0135">
"I'm not thinking anything."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0112">
"More or less."
#
<name "Battle Maid" "!PC0147">
"Hahahaha..."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Put at least some clothes on."
#
<background "ev088b00.agf" 10>
<name "Support Maid" "!DC0136">
"Then banquet wear."
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
<name "Support Maid" "!DC0137">
"How's that?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Apparently I will allow anything."
#
It turned into an impromptu party.
#
In the middle of enemy territory, but we could
afford it.
