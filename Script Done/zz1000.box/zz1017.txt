"Mm...mm...ahhh..."
#
I went back to Forzelotte's Shrine and was
with Forzelotte.
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0109">
"Aah... That little body just doesn't feel the
 same...
 Touching directly is so... ahhh..."
#
I enjoy myself with her.
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0110">
"Mm...aah...ah...mmmm..."
#
And come.
#
<background "ev045a03.agf" 10>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0111">
"Aah!"
#
She takes my semen in her womb.
#
If we're lucky, she'll get pregnant.

"Ah...ahhh...
 Darx."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0113">
"I want more children for Kozelotte."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, I know."
#
I continue.
#
So there's a better chance she'll get 
pregnant.

"Mm...ah..."
#
Her demon blood strongly influences the 
children she has.
#
To put it simply, if both parents are experts
with mana, the child will be the same.
#
If both parents were demons, then the kid 
would inherit its nature from both of them,
being better in some ways and worse in
others.
#
Well, it depends on how the kid is raised too.
#
What's concerning about Kozelotte is that one
of her parents is a human.
#
And back then, I was very inexperienced with
mana.
#
Which means that Kozelotte inherited basically
everything about her from Forzelotte.
#
Meaning that her mana absorption is going to
grow as she matures until other demons won't
be able to even approach her eventually.
#
That's what Forzelotte's scared of.
#
She doesn't want her daughter to suffer the
same loneliness that she did.
#
And that's why my other children are 
important.
#
Because of Forzelotte's mana inside me, my
children are able to approach and even touch
her.
#
So far, that's only manifested in the girls,
but it seems to happen with almost all of 
them.
#
So the more children I have, the more people
that Kozelotte will be able to be around when
she grows up.
#
This is something Forzelotte, Rakia, and I 
have all looked into, and only the top people
in Forzelotte's Shrine know about.
#
It's especially a secret from Kozelotte.
#
So I can endure it, even if she resents me for
cheating on her mother.
#
Yeah.
#
She'll understand someday.
#

<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0115">
"Ahh... I hope she understands."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I'm nervous about that too."
