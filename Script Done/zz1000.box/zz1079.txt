"Um, Overlord."

<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0102">
"H-How were my breasts?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Your breasts?"

<name "Darx">
"Oh, they were okay."
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0103">
"Okay?"
#
She lifts her staff.
#
<name "Darx">
"Excuse me.
 They were good."
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0104">
"I know, right?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Hahahaha..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, that's right.
 It's a little late, but sorry about what
 happened back then."
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0105">
"S-Seriously."
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0106">
"I was so embarrassed, and because I was 
 totally naked, I couldn't call for help.
 I was practically in tears the whole time
 that was happening."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sorry."
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0107">
"Speaking of which, what did you do to me
 back then?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, I used something called darn dopper."
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0108">
"As a wizard, I'd love to know more about it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Unfortunately, its production was delayed."
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0109">
"Even if you just have the data, I could make
 it."
#
<name "Darx">
"You can reproduce it?"
#
<name "Mirre" "!HC0110">
"I'll show you how it's done."
#
<name "Darx">
"You're a good minion."
#
Darn dopper is a man's dream.
#
But recreating it was a long and arduous road.
