<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<sprite "ta05a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0062">
"There's somebody who'd like to meet you.
 May I introduce her to you?"

"Fine.
 Who is it?"

"A merchant from Celestia."

The next day...
#
<sprite "ta06a003.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0001">
"It's a pleasure to meet you."
#
<sprite "ta06a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0002">
"I am Suisen from the Anselm Company.
 The snake is Sue.
 I look forward to doing business with you."
#
<name "Darx">
"Anselm Company?"
#
<sprite "ta06a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0003">
"Think of us as the Celestia version of
 Gunguskar."
#
<sprite "ta06a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0004">
"Well, we don't have quite the same reach as
 Gunguskar though."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<sprite "ta06a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0005">
"I wanted to meet you and would like your
 permission to do business here."
#
<name "Darx">
"Business?"
#
<sprite "ta06a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0006">
"Yes. I believe there are a number of people
 here from Celestia."
#
<sprite "ta06a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0007">
"While I'm sure their lives here are
 comfortable, they are no doubt missing some
 of Celestia's wares, and I would like to
 provide them."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<name "Darx">
"Um, I'd say that I don't mind personally,
 but I think I'd ruffle somebody's feathers if
 I did that."
#
<sprite "ta06a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0008">
"Whose?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Gunguskar's."
#
<sprite "ta06a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0009">
"I accept that they were here before us, but
 what kind of merchant stops other merchants
 from opening their own business in the same
 place?"
#
<sprite "ta06a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0010">
"Or did you have an exclusive contract with
 them? According to our information, no such
 thing exists."
#
<name "Darx">
"I certainly don't have a contract like that,
 but fair's fair, right?"
#
<name "Darx">
"They've done a lot for me, and if I were to
 turn my back on them now...
 Don't you think that'd cause some problems?"
#
<sprite "ta06a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0011">
"You are quite correct, but we are not asking
 you to turn your back on them.
 Just that we be allowed to sell commodities
 that cannot be found here."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see. Then it'll be okay with you if we have
 someone from Gunguskar join this
 conversation.
 One moment."
#
<sprite "ta06a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0012">
"Heheh.
 Of course."
#
<sprite "ta06a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0013">
"I look forward to Gunguskar's involvement."

"Heheheh."
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?
 What's this atmosphere?"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0177">
"I-I don't know."
#
The two have been staring at each other since
they met.
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0146">
"Darx, this is bad.
 This combination is really bad."
#
<name "Darx">
"What? Do they know each other?"
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0147">
"They have a rivalry that goes back years."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0148">
"They've both destroyed the other's business
 a dozen times over."
#
<name "Darx">
"I-I see."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0149">
"For now, let's just watch and wait."

"I am starting a business here.
 I am Suisen from the Anselm Company. 
 It's my honor to greet our predecessors."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0086">
"How very kind of you."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0016">
"I look forward to our business together.
 Why don't we discuss the details downstairs
 over a cup of tea?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0087">
"Fine."

<music 3>
<background "bg010a0.agf" 10>

<name "Suisen" "!YA0017">
"Well then, Darx.
 I look forward to doing business with you."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She bows and leaves.
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?
 Is all good?
 I thought you were going to discuss
 business."
#
Macdo bows her head to me in my confusion,
more politely than she's ever acted before.
#
<sprite "ta02a004.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0088">
"Darx."
#
<name "Darx">
"Y-Yes?"
#
<sprite "ta02a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0089">
"I believe I never formally spoke a promise
 to you on behalf of our company since my
 arrival."
#
<sprite "ta02a026.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0091">
"Thank you for everything you've done.
 Our company will continue supporting you in
 your endeavors, now more than ever.
 Thank you for your continued patronage."
#
<name "Darx">
"H-Hey."
#
<sprite "ta02a028.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0092">
"Of course, if you were to kick that garbage
 angel business out on their asses, I would
 be even more appreciative."
#
<name "Darx">
"T-There's um, lots of, um... sorry."

"Macdo, Macdo.
 Even the Great Lord can't turn away Anselm.
 Please do not be unreasonable..."
#

<name "Macdo" "!ZA0093">
"Rrrrrr..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta08a023.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0151">
"Darx, thank you so much for not agreeing to
 anything without consulting with us first.
 We truly appreciate it."
#
<sprite "ta08a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0152">
"And, Sofia."
#
<removesprite -1 11>

"Y-Yes?"

"A lesson.
 Come."

"Oohh..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
The three leave.
#
I flag a nearby Gunguskar maid over.
#
<name "Darx">
"Why is Sofia getting a lesson?"
#
<sprite "ta34a002.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0042">
"Umm... because they were caught completely by
 surprise. It's a very big deal that they
 didn't know someone was coming, especially
 when it's Anselm."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0043">
"With one word from you, you could completely
 shut Gunguskar out from the city."
#
<name "Darx">
"...If they're that worried about it, why not
 make an exclusive contract?"
#
<sprite "ta34a000.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0044">
"It's company policy to not make such
 agreements. Even if other businesses come,
 we succeed by quality."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
As I hear Sofia scream in the distance, I'm
glad I didn't rush to make a decision.
#
<name "Darx">
"So, why was it just accepted that Suisen
 would be doing business here then?"
#
<sprite "ta34a000.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0045">
"Don't you know there are some things that
 it's pointless to resist?"
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
So what does it matter if Sofia warned them
about it or not?
#
Well, I better just stay out of it.
