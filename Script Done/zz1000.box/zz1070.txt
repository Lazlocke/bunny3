"Sir, I heard that Ekate was in the deepest
 part of this dungeon.
 Isn't she dangerous?"
#
<name "Seasoned Adventurer" "!BC0069">
"Hahaha.
 Come on.
 It's just a rumor."
#
<name "Rookie Adventurer" "!JA0048">
"But a castle fell in the middle of this
 forest. Maybe she moved to a different home
 or something..."
#
<name "Seasoned Adventurer" "!BC0070">
"No way.
 Look around.
 This place is just cruddy."
#
<name "Seasoned Adventurer" "!BC0071">
"Low level monsters too."
#
<name "Seasoned Adventurer" "!BC0072">
"There's no way Ekate would be somewhere like
 this."
#
<name "Rookie Adventurer" "!JA0049">
"Sir, when you talk to me about that, it just
 makes me feel like you're forcing us to run
 into Ekate."
#
<name "Seasoned Adventurer" "!BC0073">
"Oh, you mean like that stuff.
 Like how talking about getting married before
 battle makes everybody think that you're 
 going to die in that fight."
#
<name "Rookie Adventurer" "!JA0050">
"Yes.
 A jinx."
#
<name "Seasoned Adventurer" "!BC0074">
"Hahaha.
 I don't believe in jinxes."

<name "Seasoned Adventurer" "!BC0075">
"Um...
 From now on, I believe in jinxes."
#
<name "Rookie Adventurer" "!JA0051">
"That means that we're gonna die.
 Please let us make it home alive first."
