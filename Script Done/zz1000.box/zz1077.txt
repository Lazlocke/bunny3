"Um, Overlord, we have a little problem in
 the Temple of Darx."
#
<name "Darx">
"What's the matter?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0255">
"There's someone doing magical experiments
 there."
#
<name "Darx">
"Magical experiments?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I can believe that.
#
Or rather, it's not uncommon.
#
<name "Darx">
"But you're asking me for help so...
 Something dangerous?"
#
<sprite "ta34c001.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0256">
"Yes. They're conducting large-scale magic in
 an enclosed space. It's been okay so far,
 but if it escalates, it could lead to the
 collapse of the Temple of Darx."
#
<name "Darx">
"That bad?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0257">
"The Temple of Darx is under Darx City, so
 there would be consequences..."
#
<name "Darx">
"So I need to drive them out?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0258">
"That's a possibility, but I have a perfect
 product for this."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0259">
"For now, we're calling it darn dopper.
 We'd like you to test out the prototype."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh?"

<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0088">
"Heheheh..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Her?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0260">
"Yes.
 She's definitely the one."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0261">
"Do you know how to use the darn dopper?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0262">
"Then I'll leave you to it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Roger."
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0089">
"Now then, let's blow some stuff up again."
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0090">
"Hm?
 Another adventurer?"
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0091">
"You look pretty crazy."
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0092">
"Oh, it's not safe to be here.
 I'm gonna let loose some magic."
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0093">
"So get your butt out of here."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sorry, but I'm an enemy."
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0094">
"...You have got to be kidding me."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, don't hold back."
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0095">
"You really are an enemy then?"
#
<name "Darx">
"That's right.
 Your magic experiments here are a problem.
 I was sent to drive you out."
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0096">
"Hmmm?"
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0097">
"Then explode."
#
Before she can cast a spell, I use the darn
dopper.
#
<background "ev083b00.agf" 10>
Her clothes disappear.
#
No, they fall apart.
#
Like all the sewing came undone.
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0098">
"...Huh?"
#
It's enough to interrupt her spell chant too.
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0099">
"Huh?
 Uh?
 Huh?"
#
She doesn't realize what happened for a few
moments before letting out a huge scream.
#
I can't stop laughing.
#
She tries to hold up the cloth around her and
cover herself, but it keeps slipping from her
hands.
#
<background "ev083b01.agf" 10>
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!HC0100">
"What just...
 Huh? Huuuh?
 Eeeeeh!?"
#
I beat a hasty retreat, laughing the whole 
way.
#
<name "Darx">
"How was that?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0263">
"It was spectacular."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hahahahaha...
 But what's the theory behind it?
 I can't imagine it's just to instantly
 destroy clothing."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0264">
"The makers said they reduced the friction of
 materials to zero or something like that...
 I'm sorry.
 I'm not sure the details."
#
<name "Darx">
"Does this work on things like demons too?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0265">
"It doesn't have any effect on clothing made
 with mana, so it's useless against demons."
#
<name "Darx">
"I-I see...
 Too bad."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0266">
"Hahaha..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, that's fine.
 Once this comes out for sale, I'll be sure to
 buy a ton of it."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!DC0267">
"Umm... I'll be sure to tell the creators
 that."
