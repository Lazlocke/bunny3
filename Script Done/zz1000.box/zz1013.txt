"It's been a while."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah. What brings you here today?"
#
<sprite "ta10a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0222">
"I wanted some advice with work, if you 
 didn't mind."
#
<name "Darx">
"What's up?"
#
<sprite "ta10a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0223">
"It's about the school."
#
<name "Darx">
"The school?
 Forzelotte Academy?"
#
<sprite "ta10a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0224">
"Mmhmm.
 I would actually like to open a branch of
 the school here."
#
<name "Darx">
"Here?
 Is something the matter over there?"
#
<sprite "ta10a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0225">
"Not the matter, precisely... The school was
 already destroyed by the castle incident.
 Annexing facilities to rebuild it for your
 children would naturally cause problems."
#
<name "Darx">
"Really?"
#
<sprite "ta10a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0226">
"Really."
#
<sprite "ta10a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0227">
"Furthermore, the more time passes, the more
 of your children there will be to learn and
 grow. It's already too small, and it's 
 difficult to make more space in the dungeon."
#
<name "Darx">
"So an offshoot school here?"
#
<sprite "ta10a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0228">
"Technically an offshoot for now, but I plan
 to make it a formal school in the future and
 eliminate the one in Forzelotte's Shrine."
#
<name "Darx">
"...That's a pretty big plan.
 I'm not sure things are settled enough here
 yet. I don't think everybody will be on
 board with it either."
#
<sprite "ta10a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0229">
"I can take care of myself."
#
<sprite "ta10a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0230">
"Besides, your concern is unnecessary.
 The teachers are lead by Logius, and while
 there are some entrenched, there are also
 leaders from the castle recruited by you."
#
<sprite "ta10a028.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0231">
"Additionally, the students are students.
 There are plenty of troublemakers among
 them."
#
<name "Darx">
"There are that many troublemakers?"
#
<sprite "ta10a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0232">
"The one at the top of the list is our
 daughter, Kozelotte."
#
<name "Darx">
"K-Koze's not like that!"
#
<sprite "ta10a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0233">
"Well, her father would say that."
#
<name "Darx">
"Grrr..."
#
<sprite "ta10a024.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0234">
"Hahaha.
 I would also add that half the students are
 your children. You would not be able to
 intimidate them into compliance."
#
<name "Darx">
"...That's true."
#
<sprite "ta10a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0235">
"So I have your permission."
#
<name "Darx">
"That's not what you wanted to discuss, was
 it?"
#
<sprite "ta10a028.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0236">
"The discussion is over, so we can move on to
 the next step."
#
<name "Darx">
"Seriously?
 Where is this place even going?"
#
<sprite "ta10a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0237">
"I'm letting Rakia choose where.
 I want enough space, but I would prefer it
 to be some ways from here."
#
<name "Darx">
"And what do you need for it?"
#
<sprite "ta10a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0238">
"Not money, but I will need resources."
#
<name "Darx">
"And you want permission to use them.
 Basically the same as asking me to donate
 them to you?"
#
<sprite "ta10a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0239">
"That's correct.
 It's difficult to come out and just say
 that."
#
<name "Darx">
"So shameless...
 Is anybody against this?"
#
<sprite "ta10a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0240">
"If you're concerned about Macdo, you don't
 need to be. She's already given her
 permission through Rakia."
#
<sprite "ta10a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0241">
"The majority of teachers and students have
 approved it as well."
#
<sprite "ta10a012.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0242">
"Logius was the one firmly against it.
 She doesn't think the safety of the girls can
 be assured that close to you. I wish I could
 argue, but... well, it is what it is."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sorry for the memories."
#
<sprite "ta10a013.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0243">
"Besides her, she didn't directly oppose it,
 but Rakia didn't like it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Rakia?"
#
<sprite "ta10a015.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0244">
"If the people with the school move here,
 many of their compatriots will also leave."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, I see. Fewer people in Forzelotte's
 Shrine means less business for her."
#
<sprite "ta10a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0246">
"Mmhmm, but she has been helping with the
 plans for a new school."
#
<sprite "ta10a024.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0247">
"I believe that's a problem that can be
 addressed with your special touch later."
#
<name "Darx">
"Special touch?"
#
<sprite "ta10a028.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0248">
"I know you have sex with her.
 You don't need to hide it."
#
<name "Darx">
"...You knew?"
#
<sprite "ta10a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0249">
"I had my suspicions.
 Oh, I'm not upset about it.
 More impressed that you convinced her."
#
<sprite "ta10a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0250">
"How did you manage that?"
#
<name "Darx">
"A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell."
#
<sprite "ta10a024.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0251">
"Then I withdraw the question."
#
<name "Darx">
"All right."
#
<sprite "ta10a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0252">
"Mm.
 My work is done then."
#
<name "Darx">
"Good work."
#
<sprite "ta10a024.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0253">
"I am done with work."
#
<name "Darx">
"Uh..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I pick her up under my arm and carry her to
bed.
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0255" "ka10a027.agf">
"Aah, my dear husband, I would much appreciate
 it if you would carry me like a princess 
 instead of a sack."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, yeah."
