The battle's over.

"...I wish I could say, but I can't."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5006">
"We have to hit it all at once with an
 overwhelming attack."
#
<name "Darx">
"Macdo."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5007">
"If left alone, it'd likely destroy our new
 branch."
#
<name "Darx">
"So what's the overwhelming attack?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5008">
"The Dynast's Mace."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5010">
"That Celestial weapon used by Rualtei that 
 they call the Fulmination Rod.
 If we remove the seal on it, it could work."
#
<name "Darx">
"That's it!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Call Rualtei!"
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA5003">
"I-I'm already here..."
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA5005">
"I don't know how to break the seal."
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA5008">
"If my sister or Kyuriha or Suisen were
 here..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Macdo, you brought it up.
 You know how to break the seal, right?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5011">
"Of course."
#
<name "Darx">
"What do we need to do?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5012">
"You don't do anything.
 I'll break the seal."
#
<name "Darx">
"You can?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5013">
"The Dynast's Mace was created by my family.
 So was the seal."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5015">
"I've heard how to do it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Ooh!"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5016">
"However, you'll have to use it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Rualtei can't do it?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5017">
"The Dynast's Mace is a weapon for humans."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA5018">
"Okay, the rest is up to you."
#
<name "Darx">
"Got it!"
#
I take the Fulmination Rod... the Dynast's Mace
from her.
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA5009">
"Um, that's my weapon though..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Thank you too.
 You took good care of it."
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA5010">
"H-Hmph."
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA5012">
"D-Don't screw it up."
#
<name "Darx">
"Leave it to me!"
#
Yeah.
#
I'm the Overlord.
#
I'm going to finish this here and now.
