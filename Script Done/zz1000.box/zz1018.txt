 You have a guest."

"Well then, Overlord Darx.
 As to why I'm here..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Let's hear it."
#
<sprite "ta05a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0015">
"Before I explain, how much do you understand
 about the relationship between Celestia and
 the Netherworld?"
#
<name "Darx">
"A truce after some big war.
 Or have I heard wrong?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0016">
"No, that understanding is correct."

<sprite "ta05a004.agf" 4 4 12>

"So I believe you understand how rare this
 place is."

 together?"

"Yes, and on top of that, ruled over by a
 human."

"Is that so rare?"
#
<sprite "ta05a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0019">
"There are the occasional stories and brief
 occurrences, but just having children at all
 is rare enough."

"Haha..."

"So, you're here to bitch about it?"

"Not at all.
 The opposite."

"Hm?"
#
<sprite "ta05a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0021">
"It is quite the interesting occurrence.
 The God King, and each house's rulers, have
 all taken an interest."

"Oh?"

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0022">
"We believe that the prospering of such a 
 place would have a beneficial effect on the
 truce between us.
 I was sent to inspect your land."

 however I can.
 All I ask is your permission to be here."

"What is it?"

"And what's your answer?"

<sprite "ta05a019.agf" 4 4 12>

"Right now, I am not your enemy.
 And if I become your enemy, I will tell you
 when I do."

 You can stay."

 Leave it to me."

 Let's have dinner together some time."

 Come here a minute."

 Can I help you?"

 before..."

"Think of him as the same as the Great
 Overlord of the Netherworld."

"I see.
 So in other words, this big shot sent her to
 check me out?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0036">
"It seems like it...
 You answered without knowing that?"

"Oh, well, if I said I didn't know, Sofia
 would have gotten mad."

<sprite "ta34a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0037">
"Well, saying nothing was correct, I guess.
 It might have caused an incident depending
 on how you asked."

"Right?"
#
<sprite "ta34a000.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0038">
"I'll leave reports about Celestia on your
 desk.
 Please review them."

"Thanks."
