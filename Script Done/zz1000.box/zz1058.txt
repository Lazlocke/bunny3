Wadatsumi falls.
#
<name "Darx">
"Tie him up.
 I have questions for him."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0077">
"Sir.
 And Forzelotte..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, you're right."
#
<background "ev075a00.agf" 10>
She's wrapped up in my other body, but I'm able
to free her almost disappointingly easily.
#
<name "Darx">
"Are you okay?"
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0024">
"Mm."
#
<name "Darx">
"Did they do anything sexy?"
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0025">
"I feel that there are more important 
 questions...
 But no. They just stopped me from moving."
#
<name "Darx">
"Good."
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0026">
"Mm.
 Thank you for your concern."
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't mention it."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0078">
"Overlord, what should we do with your other
 body?"
#
It's just sitting there, completely inert.
#
<name "Darx">
"We can't just leave it here..."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0079">
"Can you not absorb it back into yourself?"
#
It is part of me, so I should be able to 
bring it back.
#
<name "Darx">
"...I don't want it."
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0027">
"It's a waste of so much mana, but is our only
 choice to destroy it?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Seems like it."
#
I still have a lot of questions, but there's
no other choice.
#
I attack my other body.
#
It falls effortlessly.
#
Because it's back to its usual strength.
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0080">
"That's a relief."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah.
 ...Hm?"
#
It should be dead, but it instantly regenerates
from the wound.
#
<name "Darx">
"What?"
#
I don't remember giving it that power.
#
I sense danger and brace myself.
#
At the same time, dozens of tentacles whip out
from it and attack me.
#
<name "Darx">
"Ngh!"
#
I slash one, but another immediately takes its
place.
#
There's no end to them.
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0028">
"Darx!"
#
I hear her scream.
#
She's wrapped up in tentacles.
#
<name "Darx">
"Forzelotte!"
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0029">
"Nnngh!"
#
She disappears into the writhing mass.
#
<name "Darx">
"Tch!
 Don't underestimate me!"
#
<background "ev075d00.agf" 10>
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0044">
"Wahahahahaha!
 No! You will not!
 Human!"
#
Wadatsumi is suddenly standing next to my body
again.
#
<name "Darx">
"Ah!"
#
<background "ev075d01.agf" 12>
A tentacle stabs out and pierces him through
the chest.
#
<name "Wadatsumi" "!MA0045">
"Huh?"
#
Looks like that caught him by surprise.
#
He looks down at the tentacles coming out of
his chest in disbelief.
#
And then dies with a groan.
#
<background "ev075a00.agf" 10>
A quake rocks the entire area.
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0081">
"Overlord!
 It's going to collapse!
 We have to retreat!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Like hell!
 Forze's still in there!"
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0030">
"I'll be fine.
 Live."
#
<name "Darx">
"Forze!"
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0031">
"It's just holding me, not doing anything, 
 the same as before.
 I don't think that it's going to do 
 anything to me just yet."
#
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0032">
"Withdraw and regroup."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sorry, but I can't do that!"
#
I swing my sword, aiming for where I think I
can cut her loose.
#
<name "Darx">
"There!"
#
<background "ev075e00.agf" 10>
I find her hand, grab it, and pull her out in
one motion.
#
<background "ev075a00.agf" 10>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0033">
"Ngh...
 You are reckless."
#
<name "Darx">
"Up and move."
#
I grab her and we run away as fast as we can.
