"Aaah!
 It's cold!"
#
<name "Smiling Student" "!SB0135">
"It feels nice."
#
<name "Exercising Student" "!RB0110">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Happy Student" "!HC0055">
"You don't get this kind of openness in the
 dungeon."
#
<name "Supervising Teacher" "!TC0142">
"Quit messing around and start stretching.
 When you're finished, whoever can't swim head
 to the first lane. If you can swim, you're
 free to swim outside that area."
#
<name "Happy Student" "!HC0056">
"Yes, ma'am."
#
<name "Kozelotte" "!NA0043">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Exercising Student" "!RB0111">
"Is something the matter, president?"
#
<name "Kozelotte" "!NA0044">
"No...
 Ah."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hey."
#
<name "Kozelotte" "!NA0045">
"D-Dad."
#
<name "Darx">
"Ah, well, I came to visit because I heard
 the students would be using the pool."
#
<name "Darx">
"You look pretty good."
#
<name "Kozelotte" "!NA0046">
"Thank you very much, but it's the girls' time
 right now.
 You, a man, should not be here..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't sweat it.
 I'm the Overlord."
#
<name "Kozelotte" "!NA0047">
"Dad, that attitude just makes me angry.
 Please show some dignity."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0059">
"Yes. Honestly.
 You're exactly right."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hey, Logius.
 You're looking pretty good too."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0060">
"Thank you very much."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0061">
"But... 
 So you came after all."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0062">
"I took a lot of precautions.
 Increased patrols, set traps, and enlisted
 the help of the bodyguards..."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0063">
"But you made it through all of them.
 You indeed are the Overlord."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hahaha.
 No need for such praise."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0064">
"Hahahahahaha.
 Well then, goodbye."
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0065">
"Die!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Aah!"
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0066">
"If you won't stop, then I'll stop you
 myself!"
#
<name "Darx">
"W-W-What the... Ah!
 Aaahh!"
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0067">
"I will protect my students!"
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0068">
"Student president, which side are you on!?"
#
<name "Kozelotte" "!NA0048">
"In this case, my dad's wrong.
 Ms. Logius, I'll support you."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0069">
"Okay! The rest of you, back to class.
 Teacher, do not take your eyes off them!
 If any students drown, I will cut off your
 head myself!"
#
<name "Supervising Teacher" "!TC0143">
"Y-Yes, ma'am!"
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0070">
"Now, face us, Overlord!"
#
I was forced to beat a hasty retreat while
dodging the attacks of Logius and Kozelotte.
#
Well, I got to see those two in their
swimsuits, so we can call that a success.
