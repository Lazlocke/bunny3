"Hm?
 Is something the matter?"

<name "Company Maid" "!PC0310">
"No, you've just been shut up in here for a
 very long time..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Has it been that long?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0311">
"Yes..."
#
Apparently it's been two days.

"I see.
 But my body still needs a woman."

<name "Darx">
"Oh, do you want to do it too?"

<name "Company Maid" "!PC0312">
"That's a tempting offer, but somebody needs

<name "Darx">
"I guess so."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0313">
"I'll let you know when I'm available."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, please do."
#

"It should've been enough..."
