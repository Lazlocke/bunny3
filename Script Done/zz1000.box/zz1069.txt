"Okay, we're making good progress."

"Yeah.
 My instincts tell me we're almost to the 
 end."
#
<name "Warrior Adventurer" "!ZF0053">
"I see.
 Okay then, I'll write my name in huge letters
 on the wall."

"Sound g... hm?"

"Someone's there.
 Be careful."

 Rear guard, prepare for battle."

"Welcome."
#
<name "Samurai Adventurer" "!ZG0027">
"...Huh?"
#
<name "Warrior Adventurer" "!ZF0056">
"What's the matter!?
 Slice her up!"
#
<name "Samurai Adventurer" "!ZG0028">
"Shut up!
 And put your weapons away!"
#
<name "Warrior Adventurer" "!ZF0057">
"W-What?"
#
<name "Samurai Adventurer" "!ZG0029">
"You back there, absolutely don't attack her!"
#
<name "Wizard Adventurer" "!LB0115">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0062">
"Not many make it this far.
 I was getting bored."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0063">
"Heheheh.
 Now, how shall I have you entertain me?"
#
<name "Samurai Adventurer" "!ZG0030">
"Y-You over there.
 Could you by chance be the beautiful wife of
 the famous Overlord?"

<name "Ekate" "!TA0064">
".........Have a seat.
 I'll get drinks.
 I only have candy for snacks, do you mind?"
#
<name "Samurai Adventurer" "!ZG0031">
"Thanks."
#
<name "Warrior Adventurer" "!ZF0058">
"U-Um, what's going on here?"
#
<name "Samurai Adventurer" "!ZG0032">
"Just do it. Don't fight it.
 And compliment her.
 Flatter her."
#
<name "Samurai Adventurer" "!ZG0033">
"Do it if you don't want to die."
#
<name "Warrior Adventurer" "!ZF0059">
"U-Um..."
#
<name "Samurai Adventurer" "!ZG0034">
"It'll be okay. If you listen to her talk 
 about her love life for about three hours,
 she'll let us go. Think about it like a kind
 of inescapable trap."
#
Ekate worked hard as the final line of 
defense.
