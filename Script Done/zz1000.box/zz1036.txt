Giant tentacles are approaching the edge of
the city.

"W-What is that!?"

"Idiots!
 Don't run!
 We have to fight!"

"We can't.
 What are those?"

<name "Fighting Citizen" "!BC0011">
"You cut one down and another takes its place."

<name "Calm Citizen" "!LB0040">
"Focus on defending."

<name "Commanding Citizen" "!GB0026">
"Don't go forward!
 Just hit what comes at you!"

 Got it."

 I'll do it."

The tentacles are also closing in on 
Forzelotte's Shrine.

"Grr."

"Tojo, we've closed the barriers in each
 place."

"Okay, then this is the best place to stand our
 ground.
 Don't let them through here."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0016">
"Come on, we'll be fine.
 They're not so strong."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0017">
"There's just a ton of them."

"We can stop them."

 Don't take any risks."

 Leave the city to the people in it."

 Have faith in us."

"Yes!"

"Honestly, ever since the new Overlord took
 over, it's been one problem after another."

 charge."

 Disaster prevention.
 If something catches fire, be ready to 
 immediately extinguish it."

 Bring those who need treatment to the

"Report from the garrison.
 The gates are closed and they can't take in

 They're focusing on defense."

"For now, the safety of our citizens is our

#
The city and Forzelotte's Shrine are under
attack by the tentacles, causing chaos, but
everyone knows their jobs and is managing to
deal with the situation.
#
However, all that's being achieved is delaying
the inevitable.
#
<name "Bustling Maid" "!AC0086">
"Overlord, you're back!
 And Forzelotte's with you!"

<name "Celebrating Citizen" "!ZE0011">
"Yes!"

<name "Darx">
"Someone explain what's going on!"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0544">
"Yes, sir. 
 This way."
#
But in the middle of the chaos, one woman is
on the run.
#
<name "Surprised Maid" "!DC0091">
"Suisen's gone?"
#
<name "Panicking Maid" "!PC0083">
"F-Find her!"

"So... tentacles are attacking all over, and
 we're currently holding them back."

<name "Sofia" "!ZB0545">
"Yes."
#
<sprite "ta01a025.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0546">
"The form of the tentacles suggests that 
 they're your body, but isn't the size 
 completely wrong?"
#
<name "Darx">
"No, that is my body."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
It went berserk during the fight with Wadatsumi
and tried to pull in Forzelotte.
#
<name "Darx">
"I don't know what exactly they did, but the
 enemy took control of it... though it looks
 like they've lost control."
#
<sprite "ta01a025.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0547">
"Okay.
 So it's just going crazy?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Mmhmm."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta10a008.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0034">
"Do not concern yourself with it.
 Just destroy it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
It has incredible regenerative powers, but 
there's got to be a way to beat it...
Ugh, no point thinking about it.
We just need to cut it down.
#
<name "Darx">
"The city and Forzelotte's Shrine are going to
 have to protect themselves.
 I'm going to kill my body...
 No, my tentacles."

"Yes, sir."

"Is the Hall of Doors safe?"
#
<sprite "ta01a016.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0549">
"It's okay, but... where are you going?"
#
<name "Darx">
"The Lucent Crown Wall."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
That's probably where it is.
#
I just have a hunch.
