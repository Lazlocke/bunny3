I couldn't believe my ears when I heard the
report.

<name "Darx">
"This... isn't a joke, is it?"

<name "Company Maid" "!AC0222">
"N-No...
 It's pretty reliable information."
#
<name "Darx">
"I had... better check for myself."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0223">
"If you can."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I head to the location.
#
It's the Temple of Darx.
#
The deepest part of my personal dungeon.
#
In other words, the closest place to the
Overlord's Retreat.

 Isn't that Ekate?"

<name "Monk Adventurer" "!CB0056">
"Yeah, she's the monster at the end of the
 dungeon."

"I heard it's best to run away as quick as you
 can if you ever run into her."

"I can't do it.
 I can't even stand anymore."

<name "Warrior Adventurer" "!MB0045">
"It can't be.
 What would Ekate be doing in such a crappy
 dungeon?"
#
<name "Monk Adventurer" "!CB0058">
"It's too much!
 It's too horrible!"

<name "Ekate" "!TA0027">
"Heheheheheheh.
 Don't worry.
 You won't die so easily."

"On the contrary, if you do me a favor, I'll
 let you live.
 Oh, but you still can't go past here."

 We'll do whatever you want.
 Just let us go."

"Very well.
 Then first, memorize what I'm about to say."

"The wife of the Overlord, Ekate."

"Can you remember that?"

"I-I can."

<name "Ekate" "!TA0032">
"Then let's hear it."

<name "Warrior Adventurer" "!MB0049">
"T-The wife of the Overlord, Ekate."

"You there."

"O-Okay!"

"We did it!"

"Now, when you return to the surface, tell

"Understand?"

"O-Okay.
 I understand."

 Job complete."

<name "Darx">
"Um, a word."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0039">
"Overlord!♪"
#
This is the report I got.
#
That Ekate was tormenting humans deep inside
the Temple of Darx.
#
I couldn't believe it, but it was true.
#
<music 18>
<background "ev050a00.agf" 10>
<name "Ekate" "!TA0040">
"Aah! My Lord!♪"
#
I brought her to my room in the Overlord's
Retreat and immediately threw her on the bed.
#
Well, I'm not going to say no to her, so I'm
more than happy enough to have plenty of fun
with her.
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0041">
"Heheheh..."
#
<name "Darx">
"You're being unusually clingy."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0042">
"Am I?"
#
She hugs me tight from behind, pressing her
breasts against my back.
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0043">
"I think I always cling to you."
#
<name "Darx">
"That's true."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0044">
"...It's cause I missed you."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sorry."
#
<name "Darx">
"But if you were guarding the Hall of Doors,
 wouldn't you still be able to see me?"
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0045">
"That's what I thought, but you never came 
 even once!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, things were busy."
#
I had a lot of land work to do, and didn't use
the Doors much.
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0046">
"Grr.
 Again."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, yeah."
#
I gently embrace her.
#
<name "Darx">
"Speaking of which, why were you doing that in
 there?"
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0047">
"I-I wanted to be nearby, but...
 I thought I shouldn't bother you."
#
<name "Darx">
"So you went there."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0048">
"Yep."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I'm sorry I made you feel lonely."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0049">
"Yep."
#
<name "Darx">
"You can dote on me however much you want
 today."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0050">
"Really?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, as an apology for making you lonely."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0051">
"T-Then..."
#
I satisfy each and every one of her demands
until morning.

 the elevator connecting the dungeon to the
 city. How does that sound?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Are you sure?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
It's a big concession.
#
Maybe she figures that even if she convinced
Ekate to come back, she'd just be upset and
more trouble than it's worth.

 You would have to do your job for both sides.
 And as much as possible, you'd have to be

 around it."
