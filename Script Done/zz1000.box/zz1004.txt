 Thank you for telling me."

...I glance at Lotta.

"It's bad for your education.
 Maybe next time."

I really don't want to even chance getting

 Oh, I have kids too."

 But, well, it's better for my peace of mind
 to just say no."

...Anyway, the question of a reward was left
for later.
#
Still, who was pulling the strings?
#
Could it really be those angels?
