"Nnnngh!
 Ngggghhhhhhh!!!"
#
When I come to my senses, I'm already coming
in her mouth.
#
I apparently lost myself in my anger.
#
Think clearly.
#
We won the battle.
#
And then I threw her down and fucked her.
#
Five in the front, where no man had been yet.
#
Twice in the back.
#
And then her mouth.
#
So that would make this... the ninth time?
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0020">
"Aah...ah..."
#
My body keeps going, aiming for the tenth.
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0021">
"Aaah...aah...ah..."
#
She's much weaker now than she was the first
time.
#
Her hands and feet are free, but she's not
trying to resist.
#
Oh, I guess my tentacles are still pushed into
both her holes.
#
Not the whole big tentacle mass, just little
ones, about the same size as my own dick.
#
I can't transfer my whole mind to them, but I
can still feel and control them.
#
I twist them deeper into her and let them just
gyrate inside her body.
#
Unlike my dick, they stay in place, 
stimulating themselves by stretching and
contracting.
#
It does feel about the same as if I was 
thrusting into her.
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0022">
"Mmmmgh..."
#
I come for the tenth time as I relish all those
sensations.

"Ah...ah...ah..."
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0024">
"Agh...aah..."
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0025">
"Ah...ah...
 N-No more..."
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0026">
"I'll do anything...
 I-I can't take any more..."
#
She says something, but I ignore her and keep
going.
#
My resentment isn't that easy to soothe.
#
She rampaged through the city.
#
I heard all about it.
#
And then they kept attacking us.
#
She's an enemy.
#
<background "ev065a02.agf" 10>
<name "Ish" "!AB0027">
"Aaah! Agh! Nnnnnngh!"
#
I relentless attack all three of her holes at
the same time.
#
When she passes out, I sink my fingers into
her breasts and force her to wake back up.
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0028">
"Aah...aaah...ahhhh..."
#
She pisses herself yet again.
#
But I don't show any mercy.
#
Next to us, the maids are working on convincing
her people to move to the city.
#
They're telling them that this won't happen to
people on our side.
#
But we have no mercy for our enemies.
#
One by one, the maids will convince all of her
followers to join us.
