 What's going on?"

"I-I'm sorry."

"I thought I told you not to take prisoners."

<name "Company Maid" "!PC0303">
"Yes."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
But apparently some people have decided to
hold onto some adventurers for punishment.
#
In other words, taken prisoners.
#
<name "Darx">
"And yet, I get this request."
#
It's a request to expand the prison.
#
<name "Darx">
"This doesn't make sense."

"Yes. It's strange."
#
<name "Darx">
"Why?
 You looked into that, right?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0305">
"It's because of the citizens who moved here
 from Forzelotte's Shrine."
#
<name "Darx">
"What do you mean?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0306">
"Um, no matter what we tell them to do, they
 keep taking prisoners because they believe
 that will please you."

"Aaah...ah...ahh...ah...aaah..."
#
I fuck the captured women in the jail, one
after another.
#
It reminds me of when I had to deal with the
angels.
#
But unlike then, these are humans.
#
I can't go too overboard with them.
#
But actually, it feels nice and different.
#
<name "Writhing Adventurer" "!RB0151">
"Ah...ah...ah...
 N-No mo...ah...
 F-Forgive me..."
#
I enjoy my time in the prison with the 
adventurers.
