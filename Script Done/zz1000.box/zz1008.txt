"Darx, I heard you captured Miartei."

<name "Darx">
"News gets around fast."
#
<name "Darx">
"I expected you'd try to stop me, so I haven't
 laid a finger on her yet."

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0187">
"That's quite cruel of you."
#
<name "Darx">
"Is it?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Wouldn't it be crueler to not wait?
#
<sprite "ta05a016.agf" 4 4 11>

"Not to her.
 To me."

"If I stop you, I will once again be a woman
 who goes back on her word."

"But if I don't stop you, it would be turning
 my back on a friend."

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0191">
"Could it be you're still mad that I stepped
 in with Rualtei?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Not at all.
 I'm sure you were just concerned for her."
#
<sprite "ta05a015.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0192">
"Then my concern went unheeded.
 You are the victor.
 She is the vanquished.
 You may do with her as you please."

<name "Darx">
"If I offended you, I apologize."

<sprite "ta05a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0193">
"There's no need for that.
 But please let me be present for her
 execution."
#
<name "Darx">
"I'm not going to kill her.
 Well, she might wish I did."
#
<sprite "ta05a015.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0194">
"...That is a relief, though as a woman, I do
 feel conflicted."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sorry about that."
#
<sprite "ta05a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0195">
"No.
 The blame lies solely on her for ignoring my
 warnings."
