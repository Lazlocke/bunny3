"Hey! W-What the heck!?"
#
All of a sudden, a huge slime wraps around
her.
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0022">
"Ngh! Aah...ah..."
#
It must have been hiding in a tree.
#
It's very large.
#
For an inexperienced adventurer, this would
be the end.
#
There's nothing they can do.
#
But Rualtei is not an inexperienced 
adventurer.
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0023">
"Y-You damn thing!"
#
She gathers light all over her body and
unleashes it.

The huge slime evaporates.
#
Not blown off, evaporated.
#
That alone is enough to display Rualtei's
strength.
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0024">
"Okay."
#
But nobody would praise her for it.
#
Because getting ambushed by a slime is 
shameful on its own.
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0025">
"Oooh. So gross.
 What the hell?
 Geez."
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0026">
"Well, that's what happens when you jump on
 me."
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0027">
"Hm?"
#
<background "ev023c00.agf" 10>
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0028">
"Huh?"
#
<background "ev023d00.agf" 10>
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0029">
"Hey!
 Huh?
 What?
 My clothes!"
#
<background "ev023e00.agf" 10>
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0030">
"Eeeeeek!"
#
The giant slime was the modified one that
Sofia accidentally let go.
#
It only melts clothing, just like the Overlord
prefers.
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0031">
"G-Geez!
 What the hell!?"
#
Rualtei tries to cover herself with leaves
and runs away.
