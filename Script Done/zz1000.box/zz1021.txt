I heard Macdo and Suisen talking and went to
check on them.

<name "Macdo" "!ZA0094">
"What are you, a swindler?
 Don't we have some brass."
#
<background "ev036b01.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0023">
"Eeeh?
 A swindler?
 What're you bitching about?"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0024">
"You're just running your shop like a junk
 heap, so I had come all this way to bring
 quality products."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0025">
"So what? Your sales gonna hurt? Oh no, there
 goes your business. That's what happens when
 a real store opens next door and people can
 see what quality products are."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0026">
"I am so sorry about that.
 So very damn sorry."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0095">
"You little...
 Keep talking like that and I'll kick your
 ass."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0027">
"Ooh, so scary.
 Such a thug."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0028">
"I thought a merchant was supposed to win with
 prices and products."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0096">
"Now you've said it.
 If you're so confident, then let's fight with
 prices and products."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0097">
"I'll crush your shitty angel company into 
 dust.
 Bring it on!"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0029">
"Fine. I'll play with your company all you 
 want. Don't come crying to me when it's too
 much for you."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0030">
"Oh, but I do have a kind soul."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0032">
"Strip and beg for forgiveness and I'll go
 easy. And then roll on your back for me like 
 a dog. I'll pet you and scratch you until you
 piss yourself with glee."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0098">
"That's a pretty amusing thing to say.
 I could say it all right back to you."
#
...
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0180">
"They're talking like two completely different
 people."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0154">
"It's high level merchant language.
 Even I haven't mastered it yet."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0181">
"T-That's... high level merchant language?"
#
Sounded more like a pissing match between two
geezers.
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0155">
"By the way, Suisen has the advantage right
 now... Ah!"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0182">
"Did Macdo just hit Suisen?"
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0156">
"T-That was a punch beyond time.
 A chrono blow."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0157">
"I can't believe she can use that
 technique..."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0183">
"H-Hitting's allowed?
 I thought it was supposed to be all about
 prices and products..."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0158">
"It's about timing, and that was immaculate
 timing. Suisen can't even say that she was
 attacked.
 Even I can't believe the punch line."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0184">
"I-I don't get it."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0159">
"Anyway, that one thrust took her from a
 disadvantage back to an even playing field.
 Well done, Macdo!"
#
I feel like I'm watching a sport with rules I
can't even begin to understand.
