"What happened?"
#
<sprite "ta34a008.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0073">
"It's your other body."
#
<name "Darx">
"My other body?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0074">
"Yes!
 It suddenly went crazy and escaped."
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I have no idea what I'm hearing.
#
I close my eyes and try to send my thoughts
to it.
#
But it doesn't work.
#
It's like floating in a void.
#
But I can sense it.
#
It's there, but... what does this mean?
#
<sprite "ta34a008.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0075">
"The damage to Forzelotte's Shrine is
 considerable, especially around the room it
 was in."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0076">
"There were no casualties, but a few people
 who tried to stop its escape were hurt."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0077">
"It seems to have gotten away using a Door."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
That makes me shiver.
#
A lot of the Doors lead to near here.
#
It could cause a lot of harm to the city.
#
<name "Darx">
"Where did it go?"
#
<sprite "ta34a008.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0078">
"Reports say it's near the Lucent Crown Wall."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0079">
"Currently, security around the Doors is our
 top priority."
#
<name "Darx">
"If it attacks, kill it without any regard for
 it being me."
#
<sprite "ta34a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0080">
"Understood."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta01a010.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0525">
"Overlord, I have a preliminary report of the
 damage."
#
<name "Darx">
"Okay."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
It's pretty bad.
#
This is frustrating.
#
But I need to stay calm.
#
<name "Darx">
"...First, put it all together."
#
<name "Darx">
"Why did my body go crazy?"
#
I've been focused on Suisen for a while, but
I was still connected enough with it to keep
it under control.
#
<name "Darx">
"Did it become sentient from too much mana?"
#
<sprite "ta01a011.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0526">
"There's not impossible, but I think that's
 very unlikely."
#
<name "Darx">
"Right?
 Then someone must have done something."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Given what Suisen said, that seems the most
likely.
#
<name "Darx">
"...You said the people who tried to stop it
 were hurt. 
 Can you tell me more about that?"
#
<sprite "ta01a010.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0527">
"Yes, sir."
#
<sprite "ta01a011.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0528">
"After it broke through the door of its room,
 it seemed like it went straight to the Hall
 of Doors."
#
<sprite "ta01a012.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0529">
"It was immediately reported to everyone in
 the palace. Ekate, Paniverna, and others 
 tried to stop it from using the doors, but
 they weren't successful."
#
<name "Darx">
"Ekate and Paniverna couldn't stop it?"
#
<sprite "ta01a024.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0530">
"That's correct."
#
<sprite "ta01a036.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0532">
"Neither of them were hurt.
 Ekate has taken charge of security in the
 Hall of Doors, and Paniverna is reviewing the
 damage to the palace."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
What's going on?
That body's big, but it's not a real threat.
#
The tentacles are strong enough to restrain a
woman, but that's it.
#
With weapons and numbers, it shouldn't have
been a match for them.
#
<name "Darx">
"Wait, did they assume it was me and hold
 back?"
#
<sprite "ta01a024.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0533">
"At first, but Paniverna saw it as an enemy
 and attacked, with Ekate followed her lead."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hmmm..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
As I think about it, Paniverna comes in.
#
<sprite "ta14a000.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0050">
"Reporting."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She summarizes the situation.
#
But all she does is fill in some minor details
that Sofia overlooked.
#
<name "Darx">
"So, now what?"
#
Suisen must be involved, and we can't just
ignore this.
#
It is my body after all.
#
<name "Darx">
"We think it went to the Lucent Crown Wall?"
#
<sprite "ta14a001.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0051">
"Yes. I've sent some people to track it and
 confirm that."
#
<sprite "ta14a000.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0052">
"But it's not certain yet."
#
<name "Darx">
"What do you mean?"
#
<sprite "ta14a018.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0053">
"Celestials are obstructing us."
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I knew it.
#
And then Rakia comes running up in a panic.
#
<sprite "ta08a008.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0207">
"My Lord, emergency."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, Forzelotte's Shrine is wrecked."
#
<sprite "ta08a009.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0208">
"Not that!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?"
#
<sprite "ta08a008.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0209">
"Forzelotte was taken."
#
<name "Darx">
"...!"
#
<sprite "ta08a010.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0210">
"Your body did it!"
#
<sprite "ta08a008.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0211">
"Your body took the little Forzelotte!"
#
<sprite "ta08a010.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0212">
"Multiple people confirmed it.
 There's no doubt."
#
<sprite "ta08a009.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0213">
"I've already asked Kozelotte to check up on
 her main body."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<name "Darx">
"........."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
My thoughts race.
#
This has to all be connected.
#
Suisen... 
No, whoever's pulling her strings...
#
They hijacked control of my body and used it
to steal the little Forzelotte.
#
Even her little body is capable of draining
mana by touch.
#
But not mine.
#
And not my other body either.
#
Is this puppet master's real aim Forzelotte?
#
<name "Darx">
"I'll kill them."
#
I have no idea who it is, but they're dead!
#
<name "Darx">
"She won't go down that easily, but I'm not
 going to give them the chance."
