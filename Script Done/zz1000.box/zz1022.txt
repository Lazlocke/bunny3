A huge impact rocks the city.
#
<name "Darx">
"W-W-What was that?"
#
<sprite "ta34a008.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0046">
"We're under attack!"
#
<name "Darx">
"By who?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0047">
"I didn't see anything.
 I think it came from that direction."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<background "bg001a3.agf" 10>
She's pointing towards the fallen castle.
#
<name "Darx">
"The Lucent Crown Wall?"
#
<sprite "ta34a002.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0048">
"Yes. There are still angels active there.
 I think that's where the attack came from."
#
<sprite "ta34a008.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0049">
"Another coming!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Our defenses?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0050">
"The guards are here!
 Incoming!"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
A huge mass of mana shoots towards us.
#
But not that fast.
#
So the guards are able to get in front of it
and use their own mana to deflect it.
#
<name "Darx">
"That did it!
 Check the damage from the first attack!
 And see to the wounded!"
#
<sprite "ta34a000.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0051">
"Yes, sir!"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<music 45>
Seven more attacks came after that.
#
Each time, the target changed slightly, moving
ever closer to the center of the city.
#
But once we knew it was coming, we were able
to completely block it.

<name "Marialis" "!LA0039">
"U-Unbelievable..."
#
<name "Darx">
"You did well."
#
<name "Darx">
"But what the hell was that attack?"
#
<sprite "ta15a015.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0040">
"I flew up high, but I didn't see any trace
 of enemies."
#
<sprite "ta15a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0041">
"I'm pretty certain that the attack came from
 near the Lucent Crown Wall."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
It was definitely some kind of magical attack.
#
But it flew in a curved arc.
#
It came at us like a rock being thrown at the
city.
#
<name "Darx">
"Some new weapon..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Anyway, we can't just ignore it."
#
<name "Darx">
"We don't know when they might attack with it
 again."
#
<name "Darx">
"Stay on constant alert."
#
<sprite "ta15a006.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Marialis" "!LA0042">
"Sir."

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0174">
"Darx."
#
<name "Darx">
"Are you okay, Kyuriha?"
#
<sprite "ta05a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0175">
"Yes. I would like to inform you about the
 attack that just occurred."
#
<name "Darx">
"You know something about it?"
#
<sprite "ta05a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0176">
"Yes. That attack was just like something
 Miartei was studying."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I see."
#
<sprite "ta05a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0177">
"It required a very large piece of equipment,
 so I do not believe she will be able to
 relocate it."
#
<name "Darx">
"How long until it can fire again?"
#
<sprite "ta05a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0178">
"As far as I'm aware, after how much she
 used it this time, it will take quite a
 while before it's functional again."
#
<name "Darx">
"That seems pretty inconvenient."
#
<sprite "ta05a014.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0179">
"It has its uses in your own territory or near
 the front line, but it takes time to set up
 and bring in the needed supplies."
#
<name "Darx">
"An obnoxious weapon then."
#
<sprite "ta05a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0180">
"Indeed.
 Perhaps they were able to assemble it somehow
 with things left in the castle."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hmm.
 In any case, we can't just leave it there
 pointed at us."
#
<sprite "ta05a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0181">
"Then take this."
#
<name "Darx">
"What is it?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
A key?
#
<sprite "ta05a019.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0182">
"Consider it a pass."
#
<sprite "ta05a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0183">
"This will let you through the Lucent Crown
 Wall."
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
<sprite "ta05a015.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0184">
"Forgive me for not giving it to you sooner."
#
<name "Darx">
"Fine.
 But you're sure?"
#
<sprite "ta05a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0185">
"Miartei has incurred my ire."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I-I see."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
That's a little scary.
#
Anyway, we need to destroy that thing they
attacked us with.
#
And if Miartei is there, she'll pay for this.
