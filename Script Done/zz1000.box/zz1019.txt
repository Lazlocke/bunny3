<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0032">
"Thank you for your invitation to be here 
 today."
#
<name "Darx">
"It's nothing. 
 I had lots I wanted to talk to you about
 too."
#
<name "Darx">
"Also, I couldn't get everything needed for
 this tea ceremony.
 Sorry, but you'll have to forgive me."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0033">
"I am not so particular as to be concerned
 about proper etiquette.
 Tea is meant to be enjoyed."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 Thanks."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0034">
"There is much I'd like to speak with you
 about, but first, let me serve you."
#
She makes tea in the eastern style.
#
I accept it, and we talk at length.
#
She's quite the conversationalist.
#
She doesn't just take information from me, 
but makes sure the conversation goes in both
directions.
#
<name "Darx">
"Speaking of which, I've heard Celestia and
 the Netherworld were at war for a long time,
 but who was winning?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0035">
"Let's see...
 There are many opinions, but I believe in my
 position, I am obligated to say that Celestia
 was."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hahahaha.
 I guess you'd have to say that.
 Wrong question then."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0036">
"Hahaha.
 In truth, there were battles everywhere.
 It's quite difficult to say that either side
 was winning."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0037">
"Then the dragons joined in the middle of it,
 and everything became even more chaotic."
#
<name "Darx">
"Then you teamed up to fight them off."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0038">
"Yes, but the threat of the dragons seems
 beyond belief, and the details are not 
 readily available to one as inexperienced as
 I am."
#
<name "Darx">
"That kind of thing, huh?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0039">
"It was a long time ago."
#
This was set up as an excuse for exchanging
information, but I think it's also a way for
her to get her measure of me.
#
Well, I don't really care if she likes me or
not.
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0040">
"Pardon me for asking, but have you taken tea
 like this before?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Am I doing something wrong then?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0041">
"No, it would be rude to say anything was
 wrong.
 You seem quite comfortable with it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Back when I was an adventurer, I knew a lot 
 of people from the east."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0042">
"I see."
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, they were all unique too.
 I tried to look into how to do this right.
 Not sure I figured it all out though."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0043">
"Haha.
 Your manners are plenty sufficient already."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0044">
"Besides, a tea ceremony is not meant to be an
 excuse to drink tea in some formal manner."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0045">
"This is for getting to know yourself, to 
 learn, and to teach others about you."

#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0046">
"Even if it is rude, it is important to be
 hospitable, and nothing is more important
 than earnestly trying."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0047">
"And so, I must beg your own forgiveness of
 my own poor manners."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0048">
"Hahaha.
 Darx, I look forward to more conversations
 with you."
#
Apparently I made a good first impression.
#
Or maybe it's too early to think that.
#
Well, she's friendlier than Macdo at any rate.
