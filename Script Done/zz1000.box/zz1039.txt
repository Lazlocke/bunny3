"Somebody's collapsed over there."
#
<name "Darx">
"Here?"
#
It's Suisen.
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0222">
"Nngh..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Capture her."
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0223">
"Wait..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0224">
"...I won't fight.
 Listen to me."
#
<name "Darx">
"We're being uncharacteristically well
 behaved."
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0225">
"I don't have the magic or the strength."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Well, after all I did to her, I'm not surprised
she's having a hard time bouncing back.
#
When you think about it, it's impressive she
made it even this far.
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0226">
"I have a... favor to ask."
#
<name "Darx">
"...What?
 Say it."
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0227">
"Rescue Sue."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sue? Your snake?
 Isn't it on your shoulder?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Like always, she's got snakes all around her.
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0228">
"This is Lou."
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0229">
"They look exactly the same, but they're
 different snakes."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She doesn't seem like she's joking.
#
<name "Darx">
"...Continue."
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0230">
"Sue wasn't there when you captured me."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, that seems true."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I know at least some of her snakes ran off 
during the fight.
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0231">
"She was absorbed by your body."
#
<name "Darx">
"...What do you mean?"
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0232">
"Your body went crazy for a while, yes?"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0233">
"It's because Sue got mixed up with it."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0234">
"I know you have questions."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0235">
"It wasn't something that could just be done.
 Not from the start."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0236">
"That's why it took time to get everything
 ready."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0237">
"So that we could break the link between you
 and your body and take it over."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0238">
"But to do that, we needed you to not send your
 mind to that body, but to keep sending mana
 to it."
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0239">
"That's why Wadatsumi... collected women for
 you."
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0240">
"When you're with a woman, you take away her
 mana."
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0241">
"As long as you're connected, you send that
 mana to your body."
#
<name "Darx">
"...So that's why you got all those demons
 riled up against us?"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0242">
"Yes, that's right."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Hold on. Then the angels who stayed our
 enemy targeting the demon men was also..."
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0243">
"Yes, to force the women to you.
 In other words... to sacrifice all the
 remaining women to you."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0244">
"But you didn't have sex with them as much as
 we expected."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0245">
"According to the rumors, you would have slept
 with all of them."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0246">
"So Wadatsumi had to make up for the missing
 amount with Rualtei and Miartei."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0247">
"Kyuriha... made her own decision, but I think
 he expected her to act that way."
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0248">
"Perhaps for me too."
#
<name "Darx">
"So, I wouldn't realize and keep sending mana
 to my other body."
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0249">
"Yes."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0250">
"Sue gradually combined with your body."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0251">
"And according to the plan, Wadatsumi would
 take control of it and Sue would leave it."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0252">
"But she didn't come back."
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0253">
"Instead, your body went berserk."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Is Sue supposed to be able to completely
 control my body?"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0254">
"That's what I was told."
#
<name "Darx">
"Did you tell it to drag off Forzelotte?"
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0255">
"Huh?"
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0256">
"That wasn't..."
#
<name "Darx">
"So, according to your story..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Sue manipulated my body, snatched up
 Forzelotte and took her to Wadatsumi, killed
 him, and has now gone berserk."
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0257">
"Wadatsumi is dead?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0258">
"No..."
#
<name "Darx">
"I have a lot more to ask you, but now's not
 the time for a chat."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I'll keep you safe.
 Go back and get some rest."
#
<sprite "ta06a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0259">
"Sue... What about Sue..."
#
<name "Darx">
"I'll do what I can."
#
<sprite "ta06a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0260">
"I-I'm begging... you..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Much better behaved now."
#
<name "Darx">
"I wish you had been like this before..."
