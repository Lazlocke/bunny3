"Darx, I need to speak with you."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<sprite "ta05a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0223">
"I will be leaving here."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 Your inspection's over?"
#
<sprite "ta05a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0224">
"No. Miartei will be taking over those duties
 in my stead."
#
<name "Darx">
"Then what about you?"
#
<sprite "ta05a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0225">
"For now, I will return to Celestia.
 Once I do, I will gather those who followed
 Miartei and return here as your enemy."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Why exactly?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Is this about Miartei and Rualtei?
#
<sprite "ta05a003.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0226">
"Pure curiosity.
 Pure lust for battle."
#
<sprite "ta05a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0227">
"I wish to know how strong you are."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<sprite "ta05a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0228">
"I know this may seem contradictory, but I do
 have feelings for this city.
 I was hoping to avoid a battle here."
#
<name "Darx">
"That's what I want too.
 Well, you did say when we met that you'd tell
 me if you became my enemy.
 I won't attack you right here."
#
<sprite "ta05a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0229">
"Thank you very much."
#
<name "Darx">
"But I want to confirm one thing."
#
<sprite "ta05a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0230">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Darx">
"If I win, I'll do the same thing to you that
 I did to Miartei and Rualtei."
#
<sprite "ta05a004.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0231">
"I am prepared for that."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Fine.
 As soon as you leave here, you're my enemy."
#
<sprite "ta05a017.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0232">
"I will send an invitation as soon as I have
 settled on a location."
#
<name "Darx">
"This isn't what I want, but I'll be waiting."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Kyuriha leaves the city.
#
I miss her already.
