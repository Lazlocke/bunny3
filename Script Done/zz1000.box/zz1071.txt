"Heheheh.
 You've done well to make it this far."

<name "Veteran Adventurer" "!ZG0035">
"Oh?
 So it seems to be true that you've moved
 here."
#
<name "Veteran Adventurer" "!ZG0036">
"Today I will have your head!"
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0066">
"Let's see how long that spirit lasts."

"Um, Miss Ekate.
 Excuse me, could you please sign this
 document?"
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0067">
"...I'm busy right now.
 Can't you see that?"
#
<name "Office Demon" "!QB0164">
"I know, but this is very important too.
 Please."

<name "Ekate" "!TA0068">
"G-Geez..."

<music 43>
<name "Ekate" "!TA0069">
"Oh, sorry.
 Wait a second.
 Um... here, right?"
#
<name "Office Demon" "!QB0165">
"And these documents too."

<name "Ekate" "!TA0070">
"T-There's so many."
#
<name "Office Demon" "!QB0166">
"Please."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0071">
"All right already.
 Just cause you're getting in the way.
 I'll do what I have to."
#
<name "Office Demon" "!QB0167">
"T-Then, once every three days, if you could
 do your work back there..."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0072">
"That's not happening."
#
<name "Veteran Adventurer" "!ZG0037">
"Uh...
 Um, you seem busy, so maybe another time..."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0073">
"Huh? Ooh, wait.
 Just five minutes.
 I'll be done in five minutes."
#
<name "Veteran Adventurer" "!ZG0038">
"No, I'm leaving.
 It's not the atmosphere for a fight to the
 death anymore.
 I'll come back another time."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0074">
"I-I'm sorry.
 I'm really sorry."
#
<name "Office Demon" "!QB0168">
"Sorry, but I was in trouble too.
 It's really not good to wait until the very,
 very last minute."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0075">
"I-I know, I said.
 I'll finish right away, so stop crying."
