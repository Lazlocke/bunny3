"All right.
 Where to this time?"
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0001">
"Overlord.
 It's been a while."
#
This is Paniverna, one of the three leaders of
Castle Baldaquin.
#
She's one of my wives, and is in charge of
guarding the royal palace right now.
#
<name "Darx">
"How have you been?"
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0002">
"Well enough, but because we're not allowed to
 go check on how things are going, a lot of
 people are grumbling."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<sprite "ta14a018.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0003">
"Of course, I'm unhappy about it too."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Sorry."
#
<sprite "ta14a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0004">
"There was somebody who wanted to kill this
 Macdo women, but I stopped them.
 Should I get out of their way?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Hahaha...
 None of that.
 It'd just cause more problems."
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0005">
"If you say so."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah.
 So, just here by chance?"
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0006">
"No. I was told that when you made it here,
 I was supposed to show you somewhere." 
#
<name "Darx">
"By who?"
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0007">
"Macdo."
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
<sprite "ta14a001.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0008">
"What?
 That's quite the look."
#
<name "Darx">
"It's nothing. Just grateful you took on a job
 like this, and annoyed that one of my top
 people is being forced to play errand girl."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Her rank is Dungeon Master.
#
With me gone and the Dungeon Lord taking my
place, that puts her right at the very top of
the pecking order.
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0009">
"Well, I also wanted a chance to talk to you."
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0010">
"It's nice to see you again after so long."
#
<name "Darx">
"I guess, but if Macdo is behind this, then
 I assume she's up to something."
#
<sprite "ta14a022.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0011">
"You'll be fine.
 After all, you conquered Castle Baldaquin."
#
<name "Darx">
"I sure hope so."
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0012">
"I'm supposed to show you to the disputed area
 of Forzelotte's Shrine.
 Basically, where the forces who don't obey
 you are."
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0013">
"Macdo's plan is to expand the area we control
 while also developing the city.
 At least, I think."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
Well, that does make sense.
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0014">
"Rakia was there too, so I don't think that
 she has anything up her sleeve, but don't be
 careless."
#
<name "Darx">
"Right."
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0015">
"Ah, the Door's here."
#
<name "Darx">
"Got it."
#
<sprite "ta14a018.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0017">
"I wish I could go with you, but..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Not allowed, right?"
#
<sprite "ta14a020.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0018">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Darx">
"The sentiment's enough."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Well, just gotta do it then.
#
<sprite "ta14a013.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0019">
"I forgot to report one other thing."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0020">
"This job here?
 I took it from someone else."
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?"
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0021">
"Wouldn't it make more sense to have someone
 who guards the Hall of Doors deliver a 
 message or guide you around instead of the
 me, the royal palace's guard?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, that's true...
 Oh."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
The one who guards the Hall of Doors.
#
Ekate.
#
Another dependable ally, and one of my wives.
#
<name "Darx">
"Come to think of it, I would think that she'd
 rush right here when I came."
#
But she's not here?
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0022">
"I told you already, didn't I?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?"
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0023">
"That I stopped someone who was trying to kill
 Macdo."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Oh, it was Ekate?"
#
<sprite "ta14a022.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0024">
"I think I was getting through to her at the
 start, but then she snapped..."
#
<name "Darx">
"S-So you really had to stop her then."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Ekate is strong enough that she could 
undoubtedly be an Overlord somewhere else.
#
She does her job well, but hates anything and
everything complicated.
#
She likes to be in the field, but hates the
work behind it, and is fiercely free-spirited.
#
Her name has come up several times as a 
possible Dungeon Master, but she's always
turned it down.
#
Even being put in charge of protecting the 
Hall of Doors is something she hates, but I
was able to force her into doing.
#
At the same time, guarding the Hall of Doors
is the most important job in Forzelotte's
Shrine.
#
The person responsible for it has to be ready
to kill.
#
<name "Darx">
"Did Macdo put up a good fight?"
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0025">
"Hahaha..."
#
<sprite "ta14a018.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0026">
"We knew what Ekate was up to, so Ultinia,
 Izana, Golan, Tojo, Logius, and I worked
 together to stop her."
#
<name "Darx">
"Good."
#
Those are my top troops.
#
<sprite "ta14a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0027">
"Logius fought hard and showed a lot of guts,
 and managed to keep her mostly in check."
#
<sprite "ta14a018.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0029">
"As for the damage, aside from a few 
 buildings, Logius, Ultinia, Golan, and Tojo
 were hurt."
#
<name "Darx">
"Are they okay?"
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0030">
"They may be hurt, but all four still went
 right back to work, so they seem well
 enough."
#
<name "Darx">
"And what about Ekate?"
#
<sprite "ta14a018.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0031">
"She saw an opening and got away.
 She's in the wind."
#
<name "Darx">
"U-Uh..."
#
<sprite "ta14a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0032">
"For now, I'm guarding the Hall of Doors."
#
<name "Darx">
"I-I see."
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0033">
"Meryl and Rakia's people are secretly
 guarding Macdo, but we're a little scared of
 a possible ambush by Ekate right now."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
Just thinking about it makes my knees tremble.
#
<sprite "ta14a006.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0034">
"I'll report to you if we find her, so 
 hopefully you'll be able to do something
 after that, if you would please?"
#
<name "Darx">
"I'll do what I can.
 I'm counting on you."
#
<sprite "ta14a005.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0035">
"Yep.
 Give her my regards if you find her."
#
<name "Darx">
"Will do."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
...
#
I haven't even left yet and I'm already
exhausted.
