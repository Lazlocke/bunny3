"Just so we're all clear, nobody's taking
 orders from anybody else."
#
<name "Tamaga" "!PB0001">
"Mmhmm."
#
<name "Ao" "!WA0001">
"We know that.
 Everybody's equal.
 We decide by majority rule."
#
<name "Farren" "!FB0002">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Ao" "!WA0002">
"So, final vote..."
#
<name "Ao" "!WA0003">
"Do we attack them?"
#
<name "Tamaga" "!PB0002">
"Approved."
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0001">
"Aye.
 Let's get them already."
#
<name "Raffino" "!EB0001">
"No objections."
#
<name "Lotta" "!HB0001">
"Agreed!♪"
#
<name "Farren" "!FB0003">
"Agreed."
#
<name "Ao" "!WA0004">
"Of course, I agree too.
 We can't just sit back and let them raid our
 land."
#
<name "Ao" "!WA0005">
"The majority has agreed to attack."
#
<name "Raffino" "!EB0002">
"I have a report from my people.
 Scouting's complete. Their defenses are
 strong, but there are lots of holes.
 The planned route looks good."
#
<name "Ao" "!WA0006">
"The route's set too then."
#
<name "Tamaga" "!PB0003">
"Aren't there sometimes people flying?"
#
<name "Farren" "!FB0004">
"They're on the lookout for humans.
 If we time it right, we can slip by, and even
 if we run into them, just take them out."
#
<name "Lotta" "!HB0002">
"That's right!♪"
#
<name "Ao" "!WA0007">
"Seems like it's about time.
 Are we ready?"

"Yeah!"
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0003">
"Pillage!
 Burn!
 Ahahahahahaha!"

<name "Tamaga" "!PB0004">
"Let's go."
#
<name "Ish" "!AB0004">
"Me first!"

The farm here has returned to wilderness.

"I-I'm so sorry, Overlord.
 We managed to drive them off, but..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Who did it?"
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA0017">
"I-I'm... not exactly sure."
#
She's from Celestia.
#
Can she not find the culprits?
#
Or...
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0001">
"U-Um, Overlord."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0002">
"They were from the independent areas."
#
<name "Darx">
"You recognized them?"
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0003">
"Yes, there was someone I recognized.
 It was definitely them."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 Thank you.
 That's a big help."
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0004">
"B-But, um..."
#
<name "Darx">
"What?"
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0005">
"I-It's strange."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0006">
"There's a bunch of different groups in the
 independent area."
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0007">
"They're always all fighting with each other
 over control."
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0008">
"But the people who attacked here was a mix of
 different groups."
#
<name "Darx">
"They're working together?
 Is that what you're saying?"
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0009">
"I'm not sure, but they've always hated each
 other before..."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0065">
"It's not unthinkable."
#
Macdo appears out of nowhere.
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0066">
"You setting up a new base here would be a
 significant threat to them."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0067">
"I would think that the people in the nearby
 uncontrolled areas would have no choice but
 to band together."
#
<name "Darx">
"Macdo."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0068">
"What?"
#
<name "Darx">
"You're not behind this, right?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0069">
"I would never."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 That's a relief."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0070">
"..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, don't worry.
 We'll still find a way to meet your
 requirements."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hahahaha!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Come on. This is nothing!
 We'll bounce right back!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Right?"
#
<name "Injured Demon" "!ZE0010">
"Y-Yeah!"
#
<name "Recovering Demon" "!JA0001">
"Let's work hard!"
