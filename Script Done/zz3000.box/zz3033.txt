"This table and these chairs..."

<name "Miartei" "!SA0213">
"I ordered them from Celestia."

"Your tea is fine, but mine isn't bad either."

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0376">
"Indeed."

"Sister, the cake is ready."

<name "Miartei" "!SA0215">
"Thank you.
 Please have a seat yourself too."

"Okay."

"Having tea with you, with this table and
 these chairs, it reminds me of before we
 came here."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0216">
"Yes."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0378">
"I went out of my way to warn you, and you

"That's... um... huh?"

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0384">
"Are you saying Suisen incited you?"

<name "Miartei" "!SA0221">
"...I do remember Suisen coming to see me.
 Huh?"

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0385">
"Do you know anything, Rualtei?"
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0225">
"N-No?
 I just got orders from my sister and followed
 them."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0386">
"This means...
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0222">
"Was Suisen up to something?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0387">
"It does seem possible."
