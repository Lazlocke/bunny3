"Aaah!
 It's coming this way!"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0058">
"It is formidible."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0216">
"Grrrrr!"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0059">
"Now what?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0219">
"We don't have the weapons for this.
 We have to run away for now."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0060">
"I don't think we'll get away so easily."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0220">
"...Which way's the Flame Lord's training
 grounds?"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0061">
"It's a little more east, but...
 No way."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0221">
"We'll lure it there, and then run."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0062">
"I knew you could do it.
 Mia, we've got a plan!
 Just keep luring it this way."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0178">
"D-Don't be ridiculous!"

"That's what my childhood was like."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Kyuriha tells a different story."
#
<sprite "ta03a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0180">
"Aah...
 She's buried her childhood exploits."
#
<name "Darx">
"Really?"
#
<sprite "ta03a020.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0181">
"Yes, ever since a certain incident that
 happened when she was a little older."
#
<name "Darx">
"...Might it have involved a dragon?"
#
<sprite "ta03a014.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0182">
"You know about it?"
#
<sprite "ta03a015.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0183">
"A dragon had attacked Celestia."
#
<sprite "ta03a016.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0184">
"We just happened to be in its way."
#
<sprite "ta03a014.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0185">
"Maybe it would've been better if she had been
 knocked out quickly like Suisen and me, but
 she apparently suffered some deep trauma from
 hanging on so long."
#
<name "Darx">
"And that changed her?"
#
<sprite "ta03a020.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0186">
"Well, I think it's one of the reasons, but
 it's not the main one."
#
<name "Darx">
"Huh?"
#
<sprite "ta03a002.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0187">
"She always liked challenging strong enemies
 and difficulties."
#
<sprite "ta03a003.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0188">
"So even if she is now afraid of dragons, I
 don't think that would be enough to change 
 her."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
<sprite "ta03a014.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0189">
"She's settled down now... Her past is buried,
 but the memories must still fill her heart.
 I heard it's because she ran away from
 marriage."
#
<name "Darx">
"Marriage?"
#
<sprite "ta03a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0190">
"Bloodlines are very important in Celestia,
 so it's not uncommon for us. Well, it's just
 a promise between families. Sometimes you
 don't even meet until the wedding."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 Then do you have a fiance too?"
#
<sprite "ta03a020.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0191">
"Yes, but I never met him."
#
<sprite "ta03a023.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0192">
"You're more important than a fiance like
 that."
#
<name "Darx">
"Thank you, but I still feel like I wronged
 him."
#
<sprite "ta03a012.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0193">
"That bothers you?"
#
<name "Darx">
"I guess.
 I'd be mad if I had a fiancee who some other
 man laid a hand on."
#
<sprite "ta03a019.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0194">
"Then you've made quite a few men your enemies,
 haven't you?"
#
<name "Darx">
"That's true."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
No point in worrying about it now.
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, if Kyuriha really has settled down
 because she escaped that marriage..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Maybe better not to bring it up."
#
<sprite "ta03a019.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0195">
"It worries me, so please do."
