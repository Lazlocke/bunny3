"Whew..."
#
I lie down in the bed and relax.
#
I don't feel too bad.
#
I've got time...
#
I should do it soon.
#
I close my eyes.
#
<music 15>
<background "bg017a0.agf" 10>
And focus on my other body.
#
The mass of tentacles.
#
It feels like my entire body is being 
transformed.
#
It's pretty violent.
#
Like being torn apart and put back together.
#
And I can feel all aggressive emotions flooding
into me.
#
I'm aware of it all.
#
A strange calmness.
#
And then light blinds me.
#

First, sight comes back.
#
Angels wrapped in tentacles.
#
And then hearing.
#
<name "Writhing Angel" "!QB0076">
"Aah...mm...mmm...ah...
 Nooo..."
#
<name "Panting Angel" "!WB0069">
"Ah... D-Don't... No...
 Stop...
 Mmmm..."
#
<name "Resistant Angel" "!TC0069">
"Ah... Damn it... T-This is...
 Aah! I-Inside again...
 I-I'll kill... ah!
 I'm going to kill you!"
#
Moans, resentment, and the sounds of tentacles
wrapping around the angels...
All sounds I'm used to.
#
As I recognize the sounds, an overwhelming
sensation hits me.
#
My whole body is tentacles.
Everything is a hand, a mouth, a dick.
#
At the start, I couldn't stand the sensations
and threw up over and over again.
#
I even passed out.
#
But after doing it many times, I finally got
used to it.
#
My other body.
#
My mind inside that body.
#
Its memory suddenly floods into me.
#
It's like it's being forced into my head.
#
But now I understand the situation.
#
Well, it doesn't change anything.
#
These angels were thrown into this room.
#
It's just attacking them.
#
That's obvious.
#
These angels were taken prisoner after the
castles fell.
#
I took their virginity and raped them.
#
Even after all this time, they haven't given
in.
#
These are the ones that are regularly thrown
to my body.
#
<name "Writhing Angel" "!QB0077">
"Ah...aah...aaah...
 Forgive me...
 Aaah!"
#
<name "Panting Angel" "!WB0070">
"Aaah! Ah! Aaah! T-That's...aaah!
 No! Ah! Ah! Aaaaah!"
#
<name "Resistant Angel" "!TC0070">
"I swear I'll kill you...
 I swear...
 Ah...aah...ah!"
#
Despite how calmly I can think right now, my
body instinctively always hungers for women.
The tentacles move dextrously and lust for
their bodies.
#
The act is intense.
#
Their legs are forcibly spead, and thick
tentacles are thrust into their unprotected
holes.
#
It's the same feeling as if my dick was in 
them, but with the fine movements as if it was
my fingers.
#
The tentacles writhe inside their holes.
#
In and out, but also growing and shrinking,
rotating, and vibrating.
#
Stirring up their holes with each little
movement.
#
If it's too hard to go too deep, thinner
tentacles sprout from the tips to go deeper.
#
<name "Writhing Angel" "!QB0078">
"Aaaaaah!"
#
And then semen shoots from the tentacles.
#
<background "ev069a01.agf" 10>
<name "Panting Angel" "!WB0071">
"Ah! A-Agin!
 No! Not this!
 Ah! Aaah!"
#
Anywhere that could be filled normally, the
tentacles are sure to flood.
#
In every way possible.
#
But I also feel like I'm controlling every
single one of them.
#
The pleasure is overwhelming.
#
I continue to give in to my instincts and
violate the angels.
#

<background "bg011b0.agf" 10>
I slowly open my eyes.
#
It's my own body.
#
<name "Darx">
"Whew..."
#
I try to regularly move my mind into that
body.
#
It doesn't need to be for a long time, but it
does need to be done regularly.
#
At least, that's what I was told by the Great
Overlord who taught me how to create it.
#
He said that's the best way to sort out the
emotions in my other body.
#
It's easy to understand why.
If left alone for too long, you get pulled too
deep into its own sensations and it becomes
hard to come back.
#
That would be very bad.
#
Or rather, dangerous.
#
Honestly, I'd prefer not to use it.
#
But I need it.
#
Yeah.
#
I need it.
