 She may need to rest for a while."

 This is our fault."

 She collapsed because we were lax in the
 management of this branch."

 Well, go easy on her, and give her a chance

 I just made more trouble."

 More importantly, are you okay now?"

"Y-Yes?"

"Yes, sir.
 I'll take a break when I'm tired."
