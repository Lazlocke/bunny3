"Aaah...aah...ah...ah...ahhh..."

<name "Resisting Woman" "!SB0078">
"Aaah...ah...aah..."
#
I'm a little surprised at the people wrapped
up in my tentacles.
#
They're not angels.
#
They're human.
#
Human adventurers?
#
My limbs are assaulting them.
#
<name "Captured Priestess" "!RB0063">
"Ah...ah...ah...aah...aaah...
 Aaaah!"
#
<name "Crying Wizard" "!LB0092">
"Don't go in there!
 Don't go in!
 Stop!"
#
<name "Scared Fighter" "!GB0086">
"No! No... Ah...
 No! Aaaaah!"
#
Unlike angels, they're very fragile.
#
It seems like they've been raped quite a bit
before I brought my mind here.
#
I try to slow the tentacles down, but a wave
of pleasure attacks me, fighting back.
#

<name "Captured Priestess" "!RB0064">
"Aah! Mm! Mmmgh! Mmmgh!"
#
<name "Crying Wizard" "!LB0093">
"Ah...ah...ah..."
#
Multiple tentacles all ejaculate.
#
The pleasure of flooding semen into their 
pussies, asses, and mouths all hits me at once.
#
This is bad.
#
I can't stop.
#
The tentacles move all over on their own,
violating them.
#
It's no good.
#
I can't stop them.
#
I'm sorry it has to be like this, but I need
to find someone who can take it and focus on
them.
#
<name "Resisting Fighter" "!QB0084">
"Ah! Ah! Aah! Aah! Ahhhh!"
#
I have to distract them from those who are
exhausted or passed out.
#
<name "Unconscious Priestess" "!TC0074">
"..."
#
They're violating not just their pussies,
mouths, and asses, but their entire bodies.
#
<name "Struggling Wizard" "!WB0075">
"W-Where are... Aah! Agh!
 That's my... Ah! Aah!"
#
I know I have no excuse, but someone has to 
deal with it.
#
This the best I can do.
#
As soon as my thoughts wander for a moment,
it all goes black.
#
By the time I come to my senses, my tentacles
aren't on the adventurers anymore, but are
attacking Gunguskar maids.
#
I order them to stop, and this time, they
obey.
#
Did they see what was happening?
Other maids come in and carry out the 
unconscious adventurers, and then come back 
for the other maids.
#
And they bring back replacements...
The usual angels are left in the room.
#
...
#
I give the tentacles their usual orders and
bring my mind back.

But why?
#
Why possible reason would they have to throw
humans into that room?
#
They didn't have weapons, so it wasn't that 
they wandered in.
#
...
#
Better to ask than to wonder.
#
Just as I was thinking that, Rakia comes in.

 There was a mistake."

<sprite "ta08a013.agf" 4 4 12>

"There was a miscommunication.
 Adventurers who were supposed to be released
 were somehow sent to that room by mistake."

"We realized it a little while ago, but
 couldn't get close enough to rescue them.
 Um, our maids were also being attacked."

 like that."

"Yes, we're looking into what happened.
 As soon as we find out, I'll report and
 apologize again.
 Please forgive me."

"Well, everyone makes mistakes.
 The important thing is to not make them 
 twice."

"Thank you for saying that."

"Huh? No?
 We're still looking into it, but I don't think
 she's involved.
 Why?"

"Oh, no reason.
 I have no evidence or anything.
 Forget it."

"...I understand."
