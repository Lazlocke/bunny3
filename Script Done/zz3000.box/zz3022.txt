 Ah! I-I'm falling!"

 Black Diel."

"T-The Black Diel? 
 U-Um...
 Isn't that scary as a dragon?"

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0207">
"Don't worry. Don't worry.
 It'll work out."

 I knew it."

 W-Why are we..."

"So, what was it like?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0211">
".........I was a weak child, and couldn't 
 go out much."
#
<name "Darx">
"Really?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0212">
"Yes. I was jealous of the other children who
 were free outside."

<name "Darx">
"Oh?
 And you're okay now?"

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0213">
"Yes, that does appear to be the case.
 So now I can go wherever I please."
