"We did it."
#
<name "Darx">
"No, not yet."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0092">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Darx">
"They're not done."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0093">
"What do you mean?"
#
<name "Darx">
"They regenerate."
#
Just like I said, the tentacles start 
regrowing.
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0094">
"No way!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't be so surprised.
 More importantly, there's a snake over there.
 Can you grab it?"
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0095">
"Huh?
 Oh, yes, sir."
#
<name "Darx">
"That's the price for Suisen's intelligence.
 Take good care of it."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0096">
"As long as it doesn't bite."
#
<name "Darx">
"You should be okay... probably.
 Maybe."
#
<name "Company Maid" "!PC0097">
"That's no convincing."
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, please do it."
#
<name "Darx">
"I've got one more battle to fight."
#
The tentacles continue to regrow.
#
But not quite the same as before.
#
They lump together, wriggle, and grow to
human size.
#
<background "ev078b00.agf" 10>
To me.
#
<background "ev078c00.agf" 10>
Dozens of me.
#
<name "Darx">
"I thought so...
 But isn't this many cheating?"
#
<name "Darx" "!BA0001">
"Grrraaaaaggggh!"
#
I stand right before me.
#
Suisen's snake took control of my other body.
#
But my body didn't succumb to it.
#
That's what made it feel so wrong.
#
It grabbed Forzelotte, but didn't do anything
to her, then it killed Wadatsumi.
#
All of it was my will.
#
Same as it going to the city and Forzelotte's
Shrine.
#
It wasn't an attack.
#
It just wanted to go home.
#
Without any thought to the damage it would
cause.
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, I'm still to blame."
#
<name "Darx" "!BA0002">
"Grraaaghhhhh!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Let's do this."
