"Aaah..."
#
I connect my mind to my other body.
#
All at once, my thoughts are swallowed by
instinct and violently violating the body of
these angels.
#
...
#
A long time ago, I was an adventurer.
I attacked Forzelotte, and lost.
#
As I was dying, she saved me by forcing her
mana into me.
#
I'm grateful for that.
#
But that also changed my entire life.
#
First, by obtaining her mana, I became someone
who could physically touch her without dying.
#
She usually involuntarily absorbs mana around
her.
#
She can't control it, and those made of mana,
like demons of the Netherworld or angels of
Celestia, can be obliterated just by touching
her.
#
That's why she kept her distance from 
everybody and was alone, even though she was
Overlord.
#
That's what began my relationship with her.
#
After that, mana started gathering in me, and
I could use it.
#
As somebody who always dreamed of being able
to use magic, I was a little happy.
#
And finally...
#
The immense power of Forzelotte's mana inside
me gathered mana as well, but not as much as
she did.
#
If I was a regular demon, it would just have
been useful.
But for a human like me, that would be fatal.
#
Mana is basically poison to humans.
#
Expose a human soul to enough mana, and it'll
shatter.
#
In the worst case, their entire body will be
transformed into some kind of mutant creature
without any human thoughts left.
#
That would have happened to me after not too
long.
#
To avoid it, or at least slow it, I had to
release the mana that was inside me.
#
The best way to do that is sex.
#
I had a lot of sex.
#
Because I didn't want to die.
#
At first, with anybody.
#
Eventually, I had enough freedom to choose.
#
Those I loved, and my enemies.
#
Of course, I was gentle with the ones I love.
And merciless to my enemies.
#
And because of the castle incident, there were
plenty of enemies.
#
I fucked the angels, and in the process, 
learned how to take mana away from them, or
force it into them.
#
Since then, I've been able to control my mana
however I want, and accumulated enough to make
another body.
#
But that's not why this body is so different
from mine.
#
Just like always, I absorbed mana around me,
and had to have sex with women so I didn't
absorb too much.
#
But then problems started happening.
#
The fights over the castles never stopped,
and there was so much work to be done 
rebuilding.
I didn't have time for sex.
#
So I relied on my other body.
#
I'm connected to it by mana, so when it has
sex, a little bit of my mana is released.
#
I pity the women who have to deal with it,
but it's very convenient for me.
#
Well, because of that, I still need to 
connect to it every now and then, but that's
still better than before.
#
Just as things were starting to settle down,
and I was thinking about getting rid of that
body and going back to doing it myself,
Macdo showed up.
#
I still need that body for a while longer.
#

"Aah..."
#
As I'm lost in thoughts, my tentacles 
mercilessly violate the angel until she passes
out.
#
And then they slowly release her and wriggle
in search of their next prey.
