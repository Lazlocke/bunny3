"Lately, it's been peaceful around Castle
 Baldaquin.
 There's been fewer battles as well."
#
<name "Darx">
"Isn't that a good thing?"
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0042">
"Yes, but it's also unsettling..."
#
<name "Darx">
"It's a bad saying, but they do say there's a

"Aah...
 Y-Yes?"

"I understand."
#
<name "Darx">
"Okay, dismissed."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0044">
"Eeh?"
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0026">
"Eeeeh?"
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0061">
"I-I could stand one more time."
#
<name "Darx">
"...If you insist.
 I'll do it, but don't forget the orders I
 gave you."
