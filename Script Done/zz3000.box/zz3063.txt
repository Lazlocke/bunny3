"Hm?"

"You've changed quite a lot."

"Have I?
 It wasn't my intention to change that much."

<sprite "ta10a020.agf" 6 5 12>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0009">
"Hmmm.
 There is also the problem that my husband's
 charisma is too excessive."

<sprite "ta02a026.agf" 2 4 12>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0300">
"Yeah, completely unfitting to him to have
 such a lacking wife."

<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0010">
"...Oh?"
#
<sprite "ta02a000.agf" 2 4 12>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0301">
"What?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Forze, don't start a fight."

<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0011">
"But..."
#
<name "Darx">
"I'm sorry.
 Macdo, today I'm with Forzelotte."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She's the wife, and top of the pecking order.
That hasn't changed.
#
<sprite "ta02a004.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0302">
"I'm aware.
 When you get tired of her, come see me."
#
<sprite "ta02a026.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0303">
"I'll let you experience the charm that she
 lacks."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta10a010.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0012">
"That girl..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Forzelotte was extremely intense that day.
#
I'll have to go to her main body to fix her
mood later.
