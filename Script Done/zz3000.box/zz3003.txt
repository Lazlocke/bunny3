"Aah..."

<name "Ultinia" "!EA0023">
"Pani's overflowing."
#
<name "Darx">
"I was trying to do that to all of you."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0021">
"Indeed.
 Mm...ah...
 Would you like to rest?"
#
<name "Darx">
"No need to overdo it.
 None of you can move yet, can you?"
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0024">
"Thank you for your consideration."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, that reminds me, Ultinia."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0025">
"Yes?"
#
<name "Darx">
"How have the enemies been at Forzelotte's
 Shrine?"

<name "Ultinia" "!EA0026">
"No matter how you look at it, there's nothing
 out of the ordinary."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0027">
"There are occasional attacks from the
 uncontrolled areas, but no serious
 incursions."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0028">
"There's angels who haven't yet joined us,
 but while there's been negotiations, there
 haven't been any real attacks."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0022">
"Still can't convince them?"
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0057">
"They're demanding food and resources, aren't
 they?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Really?"
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0029">
"Yes.
 Of course, I've officially refused, but some
 of our followers are sympathetic to them, so
 it's not an ideal situation."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0030">
"I'm sorry.
 I do realize I'm turning a blind eye."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0031">
"If you give the order, I will take a stricter
 stance immediately."
#
<name "Darx">
"If you crack down, that might push some people
 over the edge and make things worse."
#
<name "Darx">
"I'm fine with supplying them food, but don't
 do it openly.
 Just enough that it's like someone is 
 disobeying orders to get it to them."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0032">
"Okay."
#
<name "Darx">
"As for supplies, tweak our logistics to make
 it more difficult for things to go missing."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0033">
"I understand."
#
<name "Darx">
"Is that all the work talk?
 Let's get back to it."
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0058">
"Okay."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0023">
"Good luck."

"Ah, m-me too, please."
