get past that.
#
Thanks to that, I go through her hymen in one
stroke, and all the way into the depths of her
pussy.
#
<background "ev020d02.agf" 10>
At the same time, she lets out a wordless
scream.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0074">
"Ah...aah...aah..."
#
I stay buried inside her and slowly grind
against the back of her pussy.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0075">
"Aah..."
#
She glares at me as she gasps.
#
<background "ev020d03.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0076">
"I will kill you."
#
<name "Darx">
"All you angels say the same thing.
 I'm tired of hearing it."
#
It's exactly what I expected her to say, so
I ignore it and thrust hard.
#
<background "ev020d04.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0077">
"Ah! Aah! Ah! Aah! Aahhh!"
#
<name "Darx">
"How does it feel to have a man inside you for
 the first time?"
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0078">
"Ah...aah...ah...
 S-Stop...
 Ahhh..."
#
<name "Darx">
"What?
 Giving up already?"
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0079">
"Don't...
 Aaah! Ah! Aah! Ahh!"
#
<name "Darx">
"We're just getting started."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0080">
"Aaah...aah...ahh...ahhh..."
#
My dick violently plunges in and out of her
pussy.
#
She's squeezing like a vice.
Every time I pull out, it feels like I'm 
dragging her walls out with me.
#
Well, probably because she's not used to it
yet.
#
With a little experience, it'll be better.
#
I keep shaking my hips, thinking about that.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0081">
"Ah! Ah! Aaah! Aah! Aah! Aahhh!"
#
Yeah.
#
This isn't for love.
#
I am just selfishly, greedily using her body.
#
That's all.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0082">
"S-Stop! Ah! Ah! Ah
 D-Don't!"
#
Her resistance increases, probably feeling my
actions intensifying.
#
But I ignore her and start to come for the
first time.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0083">
"Ah...
 N-No! No!
 Noooooooooo!!!!"
#
She screams loudly, but is helpless as semen
erupts from my dick and fills her pussy and
womb.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0084">
"Ah...ah...ahh...ah..."
#
<background "ev020d05.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0085">
"H-How dare you...
 How dare you do this to me."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0086">
"You'll pay for this.
 I swear.
 I swear it."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, I hear that a lot too."
#
I ignore her and start moving to come again.

"Nnh...nngh..."
#
Miartei hasn't given in so easily.
#
She's stopped resisting and just endures it.
#
That's all this is now.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0088">
"Nnnnnngh..."
#
But I never stop.
#
If she's going to be like that, then I'll just
treat her like a tool.

<background "ev021a01.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0089">
"Ngh...ngh...
 Ah..."
#
I come yet again inside her and lick her
cheek.
#
She shows open disgust, but doesn't try to
struggle.
#
Well, she wouldn't have the strength even if
she wanted to.
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, I could keep doing this for a while,
 but... I'm busy too.
 Come in."
#
My words startle her.
#
Specifically telling someone to come in.
#
She probably thinks it's another man.
#
Angels revere pure blood.
#
It's taboo for them to have multiple partners.
#
But I feel the same way.
#
I don't get any thrill from giving my women
to other men.
#
<name "Rualtei" "!RA0181">
"Ah..."
#
Rualtei is the one I called in, stark naked.
#
Miartei immediately shows her relief and her
anger.
#
But I ignore her.
#
Rualtei comes straight in, leans down close to
where we're connected, and reaches out with 
her tongue.
#
<background "ev021b00.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0090">
"D-Don't!
 Ah! Aah...ah..."

She can't close her legs because I'm holding
them.

"Mm... Ah...
 T-This is your..."

<background "ev021b01.agf" 12>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0091">
"Y-You're making me mad, Ru!"
#
She can get as angry as she wants, Rualtei
won't stop.
#
She keeps licking my dick and Miartei's
entrance.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0092">
"Ah...aah...ahhh...
 Mmmm!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Think about what I must have said to her."

<name "Miartei" "!SA0093">
"Ngh...
 Y-You..."
#
She glares at me, but gives in immediately.
#
Yeah, she knows it doesn't matter what she
says.
Rualtei won't stop.
#
Because Miartei herself is my hostage.

tongue relentless pushes her closer to orgasm.

"Mm...mm...

Her tongue feels pretty good also stimulating
my dick.

If I'm not careful, I'll come.

But I endure it.

I want to come when Miartei does.

And she's almost there.

She endures it for a moment, but immediately
succumbs.

"Ah...ah...ah...
 Nnnnnnnnnggggh!"

She gushes all over Rualtei's face.

With my dick inside her, she winds her hips
skillfully and stimulates me.

"Ah! Aah! Ah! Mmm! Mmm!
 Ahhh! Aaah! Mmmm!"

She moves her hips even harder and rubs the
upper half of her body against me.

She gets more intense until she suddenly
freezes.

kisses me.

But her eyes say she wants more.
#
Words, not actions.
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah, you're better than Rualtei."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0108">
"Aaahhhh..."
#
Her smile covers her whole face.
#
The reason she's completely changed is because
I realized her weakness.

It's...

"Mm...mmm...aahh..."

<name "Darx">
"You've gotten used to the pleasure."

<name "Miartei" "!SA0110">
"Mm...mmm..."
#
She started refusing to even talk to me and
just lost herself in the act.
#
Even at the end, she didn't give in to me.
#
For a while, I relentlessly used her, but I
got bored of her and switched to Rualtei.
#
My dick loved coming in the pussy of a woman
who honestly enjoyed it and wanted it.
#
And that's when I said it.
#
<name "Darx">
"You're better than Miartei."
#
<background "ev022a02.agf" 10>
<name "Darx">
"Again."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0111">
"Okay."
#
After that, Miartei started trying to get my
attention.
#
She even said that she'd abandon Celestia and
swear herself to me.
#
It's like all her previous hatred was a lie.
I thought it might be a trap, but I was 
worried about nothing.
#
She truly didn't want to be inferior to her
sister.
#
All of it is just about that.
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, that reminds me.
 That kiss...
 Rualtei is a..."
#
She kisses me before I can even finish the
sentence.
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0112">
"Ah...ahh...mmm...mmmmmmm!"
#
A passionate kiss.
#
<name "Darx">
"Not bad..."
#
<name "Miartei" "!SA0113">
"Ah..."
#
The way she acts always makes me think of
Rualtei.
#
And I realized something.
#
Her potential.
#
Right now, Miartei is probably better, but
who knows what the future may bring.
#
But Miartei is convinced of it.
#
That Rualtei will one day surpass her.
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
I grab Miartei's hips and stop her.
#
<background "ev022a03.agf" 10>
<name "Miartei" "!SA0114">
"...W-What is it?"
#
Rualtei has her charm, but so do you.
#
I know you don't want to lose to your little
sister, but you're not in competition.
#
...

She wouldn't listen if I told her.
#
No, she wouldn't accept it.

She needs time.

"Oh, sorry.
 Keep going."
