If you kill adventurers, eventually they'll

This isn't a normal dungeon.
Forzelotte's Shrine and the nearby dungeons
were made to gather mana.

If you aren't constantly stirring that huge
amount of mana up, things get bad.

Adventurers are the best way to stir it up.

Even now, we've got agents out in the world

here.

The women under Marialis have the duty of
being my bodyguards and security.
#
Thanks to that, I know most of them well.
#
Well, I know all of them.
#
Originally, I didn't even have official
bodyguards. That was a job created because of
how many came here from Celestia.
#
And since guarding me is their only job,
they're all fiercely loyal.
#
Thankfully.
#
I'm not being humble, it's because of what
happened.
#
Basically, almost all of them started out as
enemies.
I captured them and had sex with them.
#
A lot.
#
I broke them, bent them to my will, and forced
them to swear themselves to me.
#
Some of them have also had my children.

came back and took control of Forzelotte's

"Forzelotte?
 And in that form..."
#
She can change the size of her body however
she wants, but this isn't actually her.
#
If it was, her ability to absorb mana would
have already at least knocked out every single
person in the Overlord's Retreat, if not
killed them.
#
She doesn't want that to happen, so she almost
never leaves her room deep inside Forzelotte's
Shrine.
#
There would also be some functional problems
with Forzelotte's Shrine if she left.
#
So it's clear that this isn't her changing
her size.
#
If it was, there would have been carnage and
chaos all around us right now.
#
Which means...
#
<name "Darx">
"A clone?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Like my tentacles, she can create a separate
body out of her mana.
#
This isn't what that is though.

If it was a clone, it'd still have her mana
absorption powers.
#
So a fake?

But it looks just like her, and it feels like
her mana.

So there's a better chance she'll get 
pregnant.
#
<background "ev045a05.agf" 10>
<name "Forzelotte" "!XA0114">
"Mm...ah..."
#
Her demon blood strongly influences the 
children she has.
#
To put it simply, if both parents are experts
with mana, the child will be the same.
#
If both parents were demons, then the kid 
would inherit its nature from both of them,
being better in some ways and worse in
others.
#
Well, it depends on how the kid is raised too.
#
What's concerning about Kozelotte is that one
of her parents is a human.
#
And back then, I was very inexperienced with
mana.
#
Which means that Kozelotte inherited basically
everything about her from Forzelotte.
#
Meaning that her mana absorption is going to
grow as she matures until other demons won't
be able to even approach her eventually.
#
That's what Forzelotte's scared of.
#
She doesn't want her daughter to suffer the
same loneliness that she did.
#
And that's why my other children are 
important.
#
Because of Forzelotte's mana inside me, my
children are able to approach and even touch
her.
#
So far, that's only manifested in the girls,
but it seems to happen with almost all of 
them.
#
So the more children I have, the more people
that Kozelotte will be able to be around when
she grows up.
#
This is something Forzelotte, Rakia, and I 
have all looked into, and only the top people
in Forzelotte's Shrine know about.
#
It's especially a secret from Kozelotte.
#
So I can endure it, even if she resents me for
cheating on her mother.
#
Yeah.
#
She'll understand someday.

not.

 I tried to look into how to do this right.
 Not sure I figured it all out though."
#

"Haha.
 Your manners are plenty sufficient already."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0044">
"Besides, a tea ceremony is not meant to be an
 excuse to drink tea in some formal manner."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0045">
"This is for getting to know yourself, to 
 learn, and to teach others about you."

#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0046">
"Even if it is rude, it is important to be
 hospitable, and nothing is more important
 than earnestly trying."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0047">
"And so, I must beg your own forgiveness of
 my own poor manners."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0048">
"Hahaha.
 Darx, I look forward to more conversations
 with you."
#
Apparently I made a good first impression.
#
Or maybe it's too early to think that.
#
Well, she's friendlier than Macdo at any rate.

She wasn't lying when she said that she would
obey me after she lost.

Of course, I never doubted her.

I'm not sure I can even explain why.

If forced to say, I think it's because of our

people would understand.

Well, whatever.

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0306">
"Mm...mm...mmm...ah..."

I believe her, and as the one she challenged
to battle, I have my own role to play.

It's not fair, but the pecking order must be
maintained.
#
Especially for her, a person with her own
significant influence.
#
And for my allies who were harmed by their
attack.
#
For those in the city who they scared in the
fighting.
#
And for those who fought by her side.
#
After all that happened, for her to be here,
working under me, she needs to be seen to
suffer.

It's a twisted system.

Maybe it's the wrong one.

But it's mine.

I suddenly slap her ass.

"It was immediately reported to everyone in
 the palace. Ekate, Paniverna, and others 
 tried to stop it from using the doors, but
 they weren't successful."

"Ekate and Paniverna couldn't stop it?"

 Ekate has taken charge of security in the

 damage to the palace."

"I see."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
What's going on?
That body's big, but it's not a real threat.
#
The tentacles are strong enough to restrain a
woman, but that's it.
#
With weapons and numbers, it shouldn't have
been a match for them.
#
<name "Darx">
"Wait, did they assume it was me and hold
 back?"
#
<sprite "ta01a024.agf" 4 4 11>

"At first, but Paniverna saw it as an enemy
 and attacked, with Ekate followed her lead."

<name "Darx">
"Hmmm..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
As I think about it, Paniverna comes in.
#
<sprite "ta14a000.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0050">
"Reporting."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She summarizes the situation.
#
But all she does is fill in some minor details
that Sofia overlooked.
#
<name "Darx">
"So, now what?"
#
Suisen must be involved, and we can't just
ignore this.
#
It is my body after all.
#
<name "Darx">
"We think it went to the Lucent Crown Wall?"
#
<sprite "ta14a001.agf" 4 4 11>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0051">
"Yes. I've sent some people to track it and
 confirm that."
#
<sprite "ta14a000.agf" 4 4 12>
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0052">
"But it's not certain yet."

"Celestials are obstructing us."

I knew it.

And then Rakia comes running up in a panic.

 There's no doubt."

 her main body."

<name "Darx">
"I see."
#
My thoughts race.
#
This has to all be connected.
#
Suisen... 
No, whoever's pulling her strings...
#
They hijacked control of my body and used it
to steal the little Forzelotte.
#
Even her little body is capable of draining
mana by touch.
#
But not mine.
#
And not my other body either.
#
Is this puppet master's real aim Forzelotte?
#
<name "Darx">
"I'll kill them."
#
I have no idea who it is, but they're dead!

"She won't go down that easily, but I'm not
 going to give them the chance."
