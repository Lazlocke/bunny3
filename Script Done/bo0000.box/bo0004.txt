"That's correct. Currently, about two to fifty
 time stronger, but at the time of the war,
 they were usually approximately a hundred to
 two hundred times stronger than a male."
#
<name "Darx">
"...There was that much of a difference?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0473">
"Yes. So back then, the 90 males were about as
 strong as a single female."

"I have also heard that the males then were
 much stronger than they are now."

 So the females back then compared to the

"You are aware of the Eighte Lineages?
 It is a term used to describe the Nine 
 Lineages of Celestia, besides the Holy 
 Spirit, but also refers to Celestia's army."
#

"The Eight Lineages were decimated in the war
 with the dragons."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0481">
"The Night, Earth, Sea, and Lightning were
 particularly ruined, much more than the Flame
 and Light who were fighting on the frontline
 against the Netherworld."

"The damage still remains. The Holy Night
 consists only of its lord, and there are only
 four people in the Holy Lightning, including
 its lord."

"The Holy Earth and Holy Sea have recovered
 quite a bit, but they are still quite small
 compared to the other lineages."

"That's a lot of damage."

"Yes."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0485">
"The dragons also attacked the Netherworld."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0486">
"From the beginning, the dragons entered the
 war because the battleground was the human
 world, though at the time, it was called the
 dragon's world."
#
<name "Darx">
"To drive them out?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0487">
"That's right>"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0488">
"In any case, Celestia took advantage of that

　Oh, officially, the Netherworld came to us.
 If there's a test, please note that."

 magic and gifted them powerful artifacts."

 rampaging through the human world."
#
<name "Darx">
"...The dragons who were fighting to protect
 the human world were then attacked by 
 humans?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0493">
"Yes, that's what happened.
 But while the dragons were trying to protect
 the world, it isn't clear whether they cared
 about protecting humans."

#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0494">
"I know it seems underhanded, but it was for
 Celestia's survival.
 The dragons were that powerful."

"I see."

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0495">
"And so, Celestia, the Netherworld, and humans
 successfully defeated the dragons."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0496">
"The dragons were wiped out, leaving only 15
 males. Limits were placed on those remaining,
 and mixing their blood with other species
 weakend them while preserving the race."

"Celestia and the Netherworld were so
 devestated by the war that a truce was 
 called, which has been upheld to this day."

 What do you think?"

"I learned something new."

"I see."

<name "Darx">
"But why leave 15 males?
 If you're going to go that far, why not wipe
 out the whole race?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0500">
"It was a plea from the humans."

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0515">
"There were a few who did not succumb to the
 lies about the dragons, and wished to help
 them."

 by them and spared their lives."

"Huh?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0504">
"The truth is that during the battle with the
 dragons, Celestia and the Netherworld were
 taken aback by the strength of humans."
#
<name "Darx">
"What do you mean?"
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0505">
"They may be individually fragile, but they
 are formidible as a group, and sometimes,
 something called a hero is born."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0506">
"The many artifacts given to them by Celestia
 and the Netherworld were also a cause for
 concern."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0507">
"At the time, both sides were completely
 exhausted. There was no will nor capability
 for a war with humans, if it one happened,
 the truce would collapse."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0508">
"So the thought was that the threat should
 remain."
#
<name "Darx">
"They left dragons alive to be the enemy of
 humans, and taught them that angels and
 demons were on their side."
#
<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0509">
"That's right."

<name "Darx">
"So why are you telling all this to me now?"

<name "Kyuriha" "!FA0510">
"There's no problem with that.
 It was a long time ago, and it is no
 exaggeration to say that you are one with
 the Netherworld now."

"I'm sure that even if I hadn't told you,
 someone from the company would have
 eventually."
