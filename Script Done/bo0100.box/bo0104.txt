My other body was gone, and the battle was 
over.
#
As we expected, the damage was severe, and the
people still in the independent areas asked for
help from the city.
They decided to join us.
#
And the Angels who had stayed behind to keep
fighting slowly began to withdraw without 
Wadatsumi leading them and pulling their
strings.
#
But the truth might be that they suffered
extensive damage from my tentacles and could
no longer effectively fight.
#
There are still some people in the independent
areas still resisting, but they're unlikely to
seriously attack us, so it's not worth worrying
too much about.
#
However, that doesn't mean we can celebrate.
#
My body's attack severely damaged the city and
Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
In some places, it's even worse than when the
castles fell.
#
It hurts my head trying to think about how long
it's going to take to rebuild.

"Isn't that just a rumor?
 There's no way that's happening in the
 Overlord's city."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0086">
"Yeah, I went to check, but...
 I wasn't hunted."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0049">
".........I-I see."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0087">
"I changed my clothes and disguised myself, but
 wasn't hunted."
#
<name "Golan" "!CA0050">
"So it's just a rumor.
 Hahahaha..."
#
<name "Tojo" "!KA0088">
"I wonder where my wife is."
#
<name "Flan" "!HC0199">
"Logius, this way!"
#
<name "Aly" "!SB0267">
"Logius, over here."
#
<name "Logius" "!PA0082">
"Aaah... Happiness."
#
<name "Paniverna" "!DA0096">
"Okay, I'm gonna sing."
#
<name "Izana" "!AA0074">
"We'll join you."
#
<name "Ultinia" "!EA0084">
"Yes."
#
<name "Kasha" "!TB0001">
"Aah, this tea is delicious."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0050">
"Aah!
 How could you start drinking while I was still
 getting the snacks ready!?"
#
<name "Kasha" "!TB0002">
"Sorry."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0051">
"Is Oldeus already asleep?"
#
<name "Kasha" "!TB0003">
"Yes.
 Such a good boy."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0052">
"I'm jealous.
 Fina and Maria are so rebellious all the
 time."
#
<name "Kasha" "!TB0004">
"That's how it is."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0053">
"No, I think boys are just better behaved."
#
<name "Kasha" "!TB0005">
"Ummm, if you say so."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0054">
"I wonder if he's been picked on by his
 sisters."
#
<name "Kasha" "!TB0006">
"If that happens, I'll deal with it.
 Will full force."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0055">
"The Overlord hates it when parents get into
 children's squabbles."
#
<name "Kasha" "!TB0007">
"Ooh...
 When you say that... it's vexing."
#
<name "Filliane" "!GA0056">
"L-Let's just pray he grows up strong."
#
<name "Kasha" "!TB0008">
"Indeed."
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0086">
"It's all well and good for the Overlord to
 be working hard over there, but I'd like him
 to be a little more concerned with us."
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA0120">
"I think he's doing plenty."
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0087">
"You're okay going back here?"
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA0121">
"Yes. I was assigned by him to help you.
 However I can."
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0088">
"I see.
 Then for now... I'd like some tea."
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA0122">
"Understood."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0081">
"Overlord!♪ Overlord!♪ Overlord!♪" 
#
<name "Darx">
"Good girl."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0082">
"You freed the Temple of Darx, right?
 Can I go back there?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Once things settle down a little more."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0083">
"Eeeh!?"
#
<name "Darx">
"I know protecting the hall of doors is boring,
 but it's very important.
 Please think of it as a sign of how much I
 trust you."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0084">
"I know that, but..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Then how about another job?"
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0085">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Apparently some bandits have set up a 
 stronghold just to the north."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0086">
"I can chase them out?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah.
 Most of them are refuge soldiers, and 
 apparently there's a couple hundred.
 Don't be careless."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0087">
"Leave it to me."
#
<name "Darx">
"Take some people with you to bring back the
 loot."
#
<name "Ekate" "!TA0088">
"Yep.
 Look forward to some souvenirs."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0489">
"...What am I doing here?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0490">
"I still don't know what the Great Overlord was
 thinking."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0491">
"He taught Darx how to create that other body.
 Was this a check to make sure it's working?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0492">
"...No."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1017">
"Overlord."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB1018">
"Let's do out best."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
Overlord Darx.
#
Darx, the man who would eventually be known as
the Great Devil, is said to have continued his
life in the city he built.
