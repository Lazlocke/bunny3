"Splendid."

<name "Darx">
"Meaning..."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0480">
"I admit it."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0481">
"You're the Overlord."
#
I've been accepted as Overlord.
#
<name "Darx">
"So for a while, everything's resolved?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0482">
"I wouldn't be careless."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0483">
"When you think about the past, there are
 numerous Overlords who have been killed by
 their own advisors and followers."
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0484">
"Well, I will keep an eye on them to make sure
 that doesn't happen."
#
<name "Darx">
"You're staying here?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0485">
"The Great Overlord told me not to come back."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0486">
"It's sad, but I I think perhaps he intended
 to send me here from the start."
#
<name "Darx">
"Really?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0487">
"That's my own interpretation."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0488">
"In any case, it's time to go greet your
 citizens."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
I wave to the waiting people.
#
And they cheer for me.
#
I may still be a new Overlord, but I'll do
everything I can.
