Okay...
#
We've been able to get some information on the
people who attacked the city.
#
To summarize...
#
<background "ev073a00.agf" 10>
It's an alliance of over ten groups.
#
They're all considered equal despite being of
different sizes.
#
Decisions are made by a majority vote of each
group's representatives.
#
However, there's a core group leading them,
and their representatives hold almost all the
sway.
#
Farren of the phoenixes.
(MAKE SURE ALL THESE RACES MATCH TO UNIT
 TYPES!!!!!)
#
Tamaga of the tigres.
#
Lotta of the turtle runners.
#
Ao of the brau.
#
Those four are the core of the alliance.
#
Besides them, there's Raffino of the leaf 
nymphs.
#
And Ish of the frost nymphs.
#
All the others follow their lead.
#
...
#
It's a lot of women.
#
Now, how do we make them pay for this?
#
Well, I think that's obvious.
#
<name "Company Maid" "!AC0029">

 the enemies."

 And the Volcano Cave."

I have her tied up in front of me.

Her arms and legs are strapped tight to two
poles.

 you attacked me. 
 That doesn't make sense."

 You could have done all kinds of things while

"No."

I violently pull at her clothing.

Her dress splits, exposing her underwear.

<name "Suisen" "!YA0177">
"This dress is expensive.
 Don't be so rough with it."

"A place where angels and demons live side by
 side is unacceptable."

 from Celestia and the Netherworld.
 Their words were forceful, and they were
 prepared to follow through."

I rip off her underwear.
#
<background "ev038d00.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0183">
"Ah..."
#
She struggles to close her legs, but they're
tied tight.
#
Her unprotected crotch is exposed to me.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0184">
"..."
#
She's been composed up to now, but her shame
is self-evident.
#
She's extremely upset.
#
<name "Darx">
"Pretty cute, aren't you?"

<name "Suisen" "!YA0185">
"..."
#
<name "Darx">
"You just almost taunted me, but stopped
 yourself.
 Good decision."
#
<name "Darx">
"Or are you so upset that you can't even think
 of any insults?
 You're extremely tense."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0186">
"Nngh...
 I-I'll kill you!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Good.
 That's the spirit.
 Let's get it all out in the open."

I grab her entrance in my hand.
#
<background "ev038d01.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0187">
"Ah!"
#
<name "Darx">
"You nearly kidnapped my daughter too.
 I've thought a lot about what I would do to
 you when I caught you."
#
<name "Darx">
"I was worried that maybe if you just
 surrendered and told me everything, I might
 have to go easy on you."
#
<name "Darx">
"But there was no need that."
#
<name "Darx">
"I can't wait to see how much you can take."
#
I suck on her breasts while toying with her
pussy.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0188">
"Aah...nnh...nnnngh..."
#
<name "Darx">
"I'm asking you two questions.
 Who gave you your orders?
 And what are you after?"
#
<name "Darx">
"I'm not going to hold back with you.
 I'll do whatever it takes."
#
<name "Darx">
"Talk before I break you."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0189">
"L-Like hell!"
#
I bite her nipple.
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, but it's no fun if you talk right away.
 Hold out a little."
#
<music 53>
<background "ev039a00.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0190">
"Nnh..."
#
I press my dick against her entrance.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0191">
"Nnngh..."
#
The tip of my dick pushes her lips open and
spreads her entrance.
#
Because of how high up she's strung, I have to
lower my hips a little bit to get completely
inside her.
#
This is a little silly.
#
<name "Darx">
"You're tense.
 Are you nervous?"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0192">
"Ngh!"
#
The moment she's about to say something, I 
shove my dick entirely inside her.
#
<background "ev039a01.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0193">
"Ah! Agh! Ahh!"
#
My dick drives deep into her pussy, all the
way up against the back wall.
#
I tear through her hymen on the way, of course.
#
A little bit of blood drips out of her, proving
that.
#
<background "ev039a02.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0194">
"Aah..."
#
Well, this is just the first.
#
I already feel a little better.
#
I move my hips while rubbing her ass.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0195">
"Ah! Aah! Aaahhh!"
#
Violently, on purpose.
#
To shame and hurt her.
#
I can actually enjoy myself after she gets
used to it.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0196">
"Ah! Ngh! Ah!"
#
I want her to feel the fear, humiliation, and
pain of having a man forcibly fuck her against
her will.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0197">
"Nngh! Ah! Ahh! 
 I-I'll kill you!
 I swear I'll kill you!"
#
I ignore her and continue.
#
For now, I'm going to ignore whatever she says.
#
It's only going to be abuse or lies.
#
I'm sure of it.
#
No angel has been given in from just this much.
#
I haven't even come once yet.
There's no way she would talk just from 
sticking it in her.
#
And if she was willing to talk, she would've
done so before this.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0198">
"Ah! Aah!
 I-I'll talk!
 Aah!"
#
Not interested.
#
I keep moving faster, scraping my dick through
her pussy.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0199">
"Ngh! Aah! Ah! Aah..."
#
I push the tip up against the back wall inside
her.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0200">
"Aah! Ahhh! Aah!"
#
Her pussy is narrow and tight from accepting
a man for the first time.
#
I'm sure it would feel better if I was being a
little more considerate, but I'm not interested
in that.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0201">
"Nnngh! Aah! Ah! Ah! Aagh!"
#
I keep moving in order to come.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0202">
"Ah..."
#
She's surprised when I suddenly stop, and
terrified of what will come next.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0203">
"N-No!"
#
She cries out.
#
I ignore her and flood her pussy and womb with
my semen.
#
<background "ev039a03.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0204">
"Ah! Aah! Ah! Aah! 
 Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!"
#
My dick throbs and twitches as she struggles,
taking my ejaculation.
#
She curses and screams at me.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0205">
"I'll kill you!
 I swear I'll kill you!"
#
If I'm not careful, she may genuinely bite me.
#
But I don't care.
#
<name "Darx">
"Shut up."
#
I finish coming and start moving to come again.
#
<background "ev039a04.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0206">
"Ah...aah...ah..."
#
I can move much smoother thanks to my semen
inside her.
Satisfied by that, I continue indulging in her
body.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0207">
"Aah! Ah! Aah! Ah! Aah! Aagh!"
#
Her body is more than woman enough.
#
I do wish this was different.
#
Well, there's no point worrying about it.
#
She's my enemy.
#
And she went after Kozelotte.
#
She can't get away with that.
#
<background "ev039a05.agf" 10>
<name "Suisen" "!YA0208">
"Aaah!"
#
I come inside her again.
#
As soon as I finish, I move on to the next
time.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0209">
"Ah...ah...ah..."
#
<name "Darx">
"You're starting to moan."
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0210">

 Like hell..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't resist it.
 You'll change, little by little.
 No, I'll change you."

"Into a woman who wants my dick thrust into
 her."

<name "Darx">
"And then, when you're in tears, you'll answer
 my questions."

"Nnngh..."
#
It's been about ten days since we captured her.
#
I took the occasional break, but have fucked
her the entire time.
#
Her strength gave out a few times, but healing
magic has kept her conscious without being
strong enough to fight back.
#
I don't want her to die yet.
#
We also have questions for her.
#
I also take breaks because there's work to do.
#
While I'm gone, I let my other body play with
her, but I don't want her getting too used to
it.
#
On my breaks, the maids clean her and the room
up.
#
It'll be a mess again after I come back.
#
Doing this over and over again has worn her
down, but she hasn't broken yet.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0213">

I come inside her yet again, and she takes it
all.
#
<background "ev040a01.agf" 10>

#
Most of her body is covered in semen.
#
Her ass, her mouth, and her breasts have all
been thoroughly violated.

But still, she endures it.

 After all you did...
 That's all you have to say?"

taking a break.

"I don't need... your concern..."
#
<name "Darx">
"I see.
 Well, I feel bad for them, but maybe it's 
 time to break the rules."
#
<name "Darx">
"I know what you angels hate more than
 anything."
#
Sex with multiple people.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0217">
"Urgh."
#
Angels value bloodlines above all.
#
Virtually none of them would dare think of
being with more than one man.
#
That's the sole reason why about half of the
ones who joined my side are actually loyal to
me.
#
The only reason that matters is that they had
sex with me, therefore they will stay by my
side.
#
Even the ones who fought back the hardest
gave in with just the hint of being given to
another man.
#
<name "Darx">
"I would have done it sooner, but I was worried
 that it might break you."
#
<name "Darx">
"Normally, I hate to give the women I fuck to
 other men, but you tried to hurt Kozelotte."
#
<name "Darx">
"I have no problem making an exception."
#
<name "Darx">
"I think we'll start with five men for three
 days...
 Or maybe you'd prefer to be thrown to the
 slimes and slugs instead?"
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0218">
"...I'll kill you."
#
<name "Darx">
"That's it.
 Hate me with all your heart."
#
I shove my dick back into her pussy.
#
I'm trying to provoke her.
#
It's not just about revenge.
#
I need information.
#
Not from her mouth.
From her mana.
#
I can take mana from her by fucking her.
#
And it's possible to read the mana that's been
taken.
#
I've never done it before, but Rakia says that
it's possible.
#
But I need to make her mad to make it easier
to read.
#
I need to focus and comprehend it.
#
If it doesn't work, I will actually hand her
over to other men.
#
That's still just a threat right now, but I
can't leave her like this.
#
My instincts are yelling that we're in danger.
#
People from Gunguskar and Forzelotte's Shrine
are searching all over, but we haven't gotten
reports of anything yet.
#
Suisen has to still be hiding something.
#
That's why she's still holding on.
#
There's still something out there that could
destroy us.
#
<name "Suisen" "!YA0219">
"Aah!"

I start coming in her again.
#
<background "ev040a02.agf" 10>

#
Even if her mind is fighting it, her body
twitches in pleasure with my ejaculation.
#
Oops. I remember what I'm doing and try to
read her mana.
#
...
#
...It's no good.
#
It's not working.

I guess it's not so easy.

All of a sudden, the room shakes.
