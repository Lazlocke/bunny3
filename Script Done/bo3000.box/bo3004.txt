Right now, the city has less than twenty
people, including Sofia and me.
#
I thought there were a lot more when I first
got here, but they were just here to help get
things ready.
#
<name "Hoe Demon" "!ZD0001">
"How's it going, Overlord?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Well enough.
 Oh, there's a big stone in the ground over
 there I'll need help with."
#
<name "Hoe Demon" "!ZD0002">
"If you can't handle it, it must be a rock,
 not a stone."
#
<name "Darx">
"I guess?"
#
<name "Hoe Demon" "!ZD0003">
"That's right.
 When I'm done here, I'll come over to help."
#
<name "Darx">
"Okay, I'll be waiting."
#
The people here used to live in Forzelotte's
Shrine.
They wanted to move to the new city I'm 
building.
#
Macdo was keeping a close watch, so I couldn't
do any major recruiting, but rumors got around
like rumors do, and at least some people came.
#
Thankfully.
#
At the same time, there are those who wanted
to come but weren't able to.
#
Some of them are in important positions, and
some of them are ones I've fucked.
#
Almost all of the angels wanted to come here,
but Macdo vetoed that.
#
I'm sure it's because she hates me...
#
But it's probably for the best that they're
not allowed here just yet.
#
If the number of people living here suddenly
jumped by a thousand, we would have to rely on
Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
We can bring them here once things are more
built and ready to support them.
#
<name "Housewife Demon" "!HC0004">
"Overlord, the rope you wanted is done."
#
<name "Darx">
"Thanks."
#
In any case, right now, I've started building
this city not as the Overlord, but as just a
man.
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0076">
"I'm looking forward to the harvest."
#
<name "Darx">
"Netherworld crops grow quickly, but we've
 still got a long way to go."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0077">
"That is true."
#
<name "Darx">
"For a while, we're just at the level of a 
 small village. 
 You take care of your Sofia things, and don't
 hesitate to tell me if I'm messing up."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0078">
"Understood."
