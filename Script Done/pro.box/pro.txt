<name "Busy Maid" "!ZA0004">
"Seems like she didn't realize."
#
<background "ev009a00.agf" 10>
My name is Macdo.
#
I'm from the Netherworld.
#
Humans would call me a demon.
#
And right now, I'm disguised as a maid.
#
I'm actually an important bureaucrat of
Gunguskar, an important organization in the
Netherworld.
#
I've been given quite an important job.
#
There are two reasons why I'm here in disguise.
#
First, I'm supposed to be investigating the
branch of our company located here.
#
Any decent branch knows to watch their step
when an inspector comes, so it's much quicker
to see how things really are like this.
#
Well, it's no secret I'd be showing up around
now, but if they've got good heads on their
shoulders, they'll realize I'm here.
Until then, I can check them out at my leisure.
#
And there's another thing.
#
The other reason is much more serious.
#
It's to observe the Overlord here in 
Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
<music 6>
<background "bg001a2.agf" 10>
This is the edge of a kingdom in the human
world.
#
A vast forest with a serious of massive and
complex dungeons hidden beneath it.
#
Humans call it the Forest of the Overlord, but
its actual name is Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
It was built right after the truce with 
Celestia and designed to collect mana in the
human world and send it to the Netherworld.
#
Far too much mana was spread in the war with
Celestia. That means more dangerous people born
because of it. The goal is to reduce that.
#
That's also a good excuse to use it as a place
to keep a military presence in the human world
as kind of a neutral zone.
#
Celestia had the same idea and built their own
similar structure. 
Both sides accepted this compromise.
#
It's weird to say, but I agree with Celestia
here.
#
If you really think about it, there had to have
been a lot of strings being pulled behind the
scenes.
#
<music 39>
<background "bg002a0.agf" 10>
Now then, Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
Forzelotte, who it's named for, is supposed to
be the Overlord here, but a while back, out of
nowhere, everybody was talking about it because
a human became the Overlord instead.
#
When I heard that Overlord Aishies accepted it,
I couldn't believe my ears.
#
Well, it's unusual, but if it's what's best for
the Netherworld, it's fine.
#
That wouldn't be enough of a reason to send me
to investigate.
#
I'm here because of something that happened a
few years back.
#
<music 16>
<background "bg006a0.agf" 10>
Castle Baldaquin.
#
A place created by Celestials to collect mana.
#
They then converted it into a sky fortress,
floating high in the air.
#
It fell.
#
It fell on top of Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
<background "ev092a00.agf" 10>
Right before that happened, the Celestial army
stationed there launched a huge ambush on
Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
It very well could have lead to all out war
with Celestia.
#
But this human Overlord successfully prevented
that from happening.
#
I guess human Overlords have their uses.
#
It turned out to be because Celestia's mana
collection system went crazy.
#
Put simply, it reacted with the Netherworld's
mana collection system.
#
The two attracted each other and caused chaos.
#
Yeah, that's putting it mildly.
#
Castle Baldaquin wasn't the only sky fortress
Celestia had that was made to collect mana.
#
They officially told the Netherworld they had
12, but there were actually 16.
#
Half of them, eight in total, ended up above
Forzelotte's Shrine, with five of them falling.
#
After the fifth time, Celestia decided it was
serious enough to shut them all down.
#
But the damage to Forzelotte's Shrine from 
having five castles fall on it cannot be
understated.
#
Frankly, it was enough of a fiasco that the
Netherworld could have extracted major
concessions from Celestia.
#
But they didn't.
#
That's part of why I'm here.
#
<music 43>
This human Overlord.
His name is Darx.
#
After they drove back the Celestials who 
attacked Forzelotte's Shrine, they 
counterattacked Castle Baldaquin with a small
number of warriors. 
#
<background "ev093a00.agf" 10>
In the process, they captured, imprisoned, and
raped a number of young women soldiers.
#
It didn't matter if they were some important
person in Celestia or not.
#
To make things worse, many of them became
pregnant with his children.
#
It wouldn't matter if it was only a few, or
even a few dozen, but this was closer to 
hundreds, close to thousands.
#
It was a huge joke in the Netherworld.
#
You almost can't help but feel sorry for them
knowing what Celestia is like.
#
Celestials value their bloodlines. 
They don't have sex with anybody but their
spouses.
#
They're also exceedingly arrogant.
Humans are lesser beings to them.
Being raped by a human, and especially having
one's child would make them pariahs.
#
Even though they're our enemies, I pity them
that fate.
#
Because of that, almost all of them lost their
homes in Celestia and wanted to move to
Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
More than two thousand of them.
#
The big problem there is that almost all of
them were soldiers.
#
It's not a significant number of Celestials, 
but it is a significant number of Celestials
in the human world.
#
<background "ev094a00.agf" 10>
What's more, it includes some of their
commanders.
#
So this is yet another incident that could've
easily sparked war with Celestia.
#
The Netherworld should have rejected them and
sent them away.
#
But they had no place in Celestia anymore.
#
Some of them may have even been imprisoned if
they tried to go back.
#
The human Overlord wasn't willing to turn them
away.
#
Apparently he told Lord Aishies that he would
go to war with the Netherworld if he was 
ordered to send them away.
I don't know if he's brave or stupid.
#
I thought it was just a rumor, but I've also
heard that one of the underlords who was 
there when the message was delivered fainted.
It must be true.
#
Anyway, the Netherworld accepted the refuges.
Considering the mana absorption systems that
went haywire, including Castle Baldaquin's,
it was accepted as a wash.
#
<background "bg001a2.agf" 10>
And the place they settled was Forzelotte's 
Shrine.
#
It's probably already obvious.
#
That's what I'm here to look into.
#
<music 45>
<background "ev071a00.agf" 10>
This is a place in the human world where
demons and Celestials live together under
human leadership.
#
With a human calling himself an Overlord no
less.
#
<music 43>
<background "ev009a00.agf" 10>
It cannot be ignored.
#
And if I judge it to be dangerous, then my
priority changes from observation to 
investigation.
#
<background "ev009a02.agf" 12>
In the worst case, assassination of this
human Overlord is not out of the question.
#
...
#
<background "ev009a00.agf" 12>
Well, there's no need to get ahead of myself.
#
This human Overlord seems to be more aligned
with the Netherworld.
#
He took the former Overlord, Forzelotte, as
his wife, and had a child with her.
#
His reputation is good, and while I have my
doubts regarding his capabailities, he's well
supported by those around him.
#
His sexual proclivities towards women could be
an issue, but the basics could be useful.
#
He's only violent with his enemies.
#
For me personally, considering the amount of
business he does with Gunguskar, I would
consider us to be on friendly terms.
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0005">
"Well, I haven't seen him in action yet..."

#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0007">
"What is it?"
#
This room...
I have no idea what's here.
#
All I know is that newcomers should stay away
from it.
#
It's covered in strange locks.
#
But this would be an odd place for a treasure
vault.
#
The human Overlord's room is further back than
this.
#
Hmm.
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0008">

Her curiosity got the best of her.

Again, my name is Darx.
#
In search of a life of freedom, I became an
adventurer, and during my life of adventure,
I ended up losing to the Overlord and becoming
a minion.
#
I didn't exactly have a choice in the matter.
I was trying to kill the Overlord at the time,
and it was either that or die.
I lost, so I took the only choice I had.
#
Well, there is the point that the Overlord was
a woman.
#
It definitely caught my eye.
#
As a useful minion, I advanced through the
ranks.
#
And after a number of trials and tribulations,
I ended up as Overlord before I realized it.

"Mm... If you'd be so kind..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Ah..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I pull the angels to me and hold them close.
#
As you can tell from how many children I 
have, I am insatiable.
#
I was like that from the start, but I have
the excuse of mana now.
#
It happened when I fought Forzelotte and
lost.
#
I nearly died.
#
She saved my life, but the way she did it
was pretty rough.
#
She forced some of her mana into me.
#
I was suddenly and involuntarily full of
mana, and that drove my soul crazy.
#
The only way to keep myself intact is to
expel mana.
#
In other words, sex with women.
#
<name "Loving Demon" "!QB0011">
"Mmm... My Lord..."
#
<name "Sexy Demon" "!WB0016">
"Mm...ah...ahhh..."
#
And my stamina was basically unlimited 
because of the mana, so I had sex with 
countless women.
#
Well, aside from those who come on to me
themselves, only my enemies.
#
Especially my enemies.
#
I think it's because of the mana, or maybe
just my natural wild side, but I want those
who I can vent myself on without mercy.
#
When the Castle Baldaquin incident happened,
it came with hundreds of enemies, and was the
start of my brood.
#
The more times I did it, the more I've been
able to control my own mana.
#
I've learned how to take mana from the ones
I have sex with, and how I can more easily
transfer it into them.
#
Recently, I even became able to create 
another body using just my mana.
I'm proud of my growth, if I do say so
myself.
#
Well, what I can do with that other me is
still pretty limited though.
#
<name "Loving Demon" "!QB0012">
"My Lord?"

<name "Darx">

#
<name "Loving Demon" "!QB0013">

"Mmgh! Mmmgh!
 Nnnngh..."

In a room in the royal palace, wrapped in
tentacles, being violated relentlessly.
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0010">
"Ah...aah..."
#
These tentacles...
#
They're the other me.
#
I made it to deal with my lust.
#
Rakia says it looks like this because it's
the avatar of my lust.
#
This me lives and breathes on its own, dealing
with my lust.
#
Meaning it has sex with women.
#
It's just an extension of myself, and
completely under control of the real me.
#
But it's not very bright.
#
About as smart as a well trained dog.
#
Most of its brain is focused on how to have
sex with women, but since it was created to
have sex without killing them, it's not 
exactly safe to be around.
#
In particular, it doesn't think much about
who it's with.
#
It won't go after my daughters because they
have the same mana as me, but it's a threat
to everybody else.
#
So it's kept locked up in a room by itself,
and women for it to have sex with are thrown
in.
#
Everybody knows about it.
#
And everybody knows to stay far away from the
room.
#
I have no idea what she was doing there.
#
I wouldn't have thought she'd be caught by it.
#
The room is locked tight, but it's not like
it's all that strong.
#
A regular person wouldn't stand a chance 
against it, but a trained fighter would be
able to handle it as long as they weren't
careless.
#
Anyway, I touch one of my tentacles.
#
I can share its senses without touching it,
but I can read its memories through contact,
and recall the memories of the tentacles
violating women.
#
<background "ev010a00.agf" 10>
Macdo entered the room.
#
She was caught by complete surprise.
#
My tentacles were pleased to see a new woman
and grabbed her by the arms and legs.
#
The rest is history.
#
And our memories align.
#
Ah, it was then...

Now that I understand what happened, I ask
Rakia what we're going to do about it.

I glance at Rakia.
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0055">
"Nothing happened?
 It won't be a problem?
 There's just no way that's true.
 She's definitely mad about it."
#
The look in her eyes make it clear I'm on my
own.
#
I can't really argue with that.
#
<name "Darx">
"Uh, what do you mean?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0024">
"Maybe I was too indirect.
 Let me make it simple for you."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0025">
"I have judged that your current abilities are
 insufficient to be Overlord."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0026">
"If you disagree with this decision, then
 prove yourself to me."

"What reasons do you have to think I'm
 'insufficient?'"
#
<background "ev011b00.agf" 12>
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0027">
"Too many to count."
#
Documents appear out of thin air around her.
#
Some are papers identifying her, some are
formal declarations of her authority, but most
are research reports on me.
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0028">
"Your leadership of singular or small groups
 is sufficient, but you are grossly incapable
 of commanding a large army, running a city,
 or similar."
#
<name "Darx">
"This gross incapability is the big reason
 why I'm insufficient?"
#
That's not wrong, per se.
#
I would readily admit that myself.
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0029">
"If you cannot convince me otherwise, then my
 decision will be to revoke your status as
 Overlord."
#
<name "Darx">
"Ah, hold up.
 Do you even have the authority to fire me?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0030">
"I do not myself, but I report directly to
 Lord Ashies of the Netherworld.
 My report will go not only to him, but to
 all of his aides."
#
<name "Darx">
"...I see."
#
Same as if she had gone missing then.
It's not something he'd be able to ignore.
#
She may not have the direct authority, but
she can make it happen.
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0031">
"Do we have an understanding?"
#
<name "Darx">
"So it's war then."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0032">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Darx">
"It's obvious it doesn't matter what I do.
 You've already made up your mind.
 And I don't feel like being your dancing
 monkey."
#
<name "Darx">
"I don't care if I'm not officially an
 Overlord, but getting fired would cause me a
 lot of problems."
#
Yeah, that barely begins to cover it.
#
<name "Darx">
"I've got a lot of kids to take care of too."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0033">
"Oh?"
#
She responds to my open hostility.
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0034">
"War? With the Netherworld?
 Or with me?"
#
<name "Darx">
"Both."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0035">
"Both? Heheheh...
 Then I would have to stop that...
 Perhaps by killing you right here."
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't be ridiculous.
 I don't know how you normally are, but the
 other me had its way with you for days."
#
<name "Darx">
"I don't think I'd even break a sweat killing
 you right now."
#
<name "Darx">
"Oh, but I think I'll throw you back to the
 tentacles before I do.
 It looked to me like they weren't finished
 with you yet."
#
<background "ev011b01.agf" 12>

"Y-You bastard!"
#
She moves to fight, but someone gets in the
way.
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0056">
"H-H-Hold on.
 Hold on just a minute."
#
Rakia.
#
Ah, now she's really in tears.
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0057">
"D-Darx, don't... don't lose your temper.
 That won't help."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0058">
"Yes, that won't help anything.
 Losing your temper never does any good.
 Only merchants need to make snap decisions.
 A king deliberates thoroughly before acting."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0059">
"Right?"
#
That final 'right' robs me of fight.
She turns to Macdo.
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0060">
"Miss Macdo, you're angry because and saying
 that because you're mad at him for what
 happened?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0037">
"...No, I truly believe that he is
 unqualified."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0061">
"Yes, I see.
 I apologize for my assumption."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0062">
"However, you may not have realized before
 coming here that there are a significant
 number of Celestials here."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0063">
"From what you've said, I believe you want to
 avoid this place becoming one of Celestia's
 outposts.
 Is that correct?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0038">
"...As a demon, I would prefer that not to
 happen."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0064">
"Yes, right?"
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0039">
"...Perhaps I spoke out of line.
 I apologize, Darx."

"However, I do not take back what I said."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0041">
"Your inadequacies are clear."
#
<name "Macdo" "!ZA0042">
"Prove to me that you are not unqualified."
#
She's not backing down.
#
Rakia speaks up even before I reach for my
sword.
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0065">
"What if Gunguskar were to provide a task for
 him to complete to prove himself.
 Would that suffice?"
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0066">
"He would be able to prove his capabilities,
 and because our company's reputation would
 be on the line, it would be impartial and
 fair."
#
<name "Rakia" "!ZC0067">
"And Darx, wouldn't that also assure you that
 you are being given a fair chance and would
 be agreeable with you?"

After that meeting, the two of them had their
own private meeting.
#
To discuss how to measure me.
#
All we're doing is delaying the problem.
#
If I can't change her mind, I'll lose my
position as Overlord.
#
If I fight back, that means war.
#
Maybe I should just abdicate.
#
...But when I think about Forzelotte, I know
that's not an option.
#
We could always try for a puppet ruler...

Let's see what Rakia can manage for now.

If she's involved, it shouldn't be too awful.

Ten days later...
#
I've spent the whole time searching that cave.
#
There's nothing special about it.
#
There's only a few monsters, and they're all
so weak that they ran off as soon as they saw
me.
#
It's not dangerous.
#
The only dangerous thing here is the cave
itself.
#
It's not an actual dungeon, just a regular,
natural cave system.
#
So it's hard finding out where I'm even 
supposed to be going.
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0046">
"O-Overlord, p-please help me."
#
<name "Darx">
"Don't struggle.
 Hold still."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0047">
"Eek! I-I'm f-falling..."
#
<name "Darx">
"You're fine.
 Come on."
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0048">
"T-Thank you very much."
#
I could be going faster if I was by myself,
but having her with me is slowing me down.
#
Maybe I should leave her behind.
#
...No. If Macdo has something up her sleeve,
I want to have someone from Gunguskar with me
in case I need what's in her head.
#
It's the right call to bring her.
#
And that was proven correct when we reached
the end of the cave.
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0049">
"Overlord, there's something here."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
Doesn't look like anything to me.
#
But she casts some kind of spell and then I
can see it too.
#
<name "Sofia" "!ZB0050">
"An elevator up?"
#
<name "Darx">
"What's this doing here?"
#
We exchange a look and get on.

"This is..."
#
We emerge in a forest.
#
Considering how high up we are, this must be
the surface.
#
But the thing that steals the view is the
giant tree right in front of us.
#
I saw a lot of big trees as an adventurer,
but this one is a whole different story.
#
Also, I can see windows and a door on it.
#
Is that a house?
#
I would assume the doors and windows are
human size, but the trees so big that it
makes it look like a house for fairies.
