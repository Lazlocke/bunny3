This hot spring's for me only.

So despite how it looks, not many of the people
here are too shy.

She doesn't actually report like this every

We're close enough to be able to pick up on
each other like that.

"Anyway, it'd be trouble if she decides to
 come back, so let me continue the report."

"You've gotten pretty good."

"Against my will."
#
Meryl's possibly who I've been with more than
anybody else.
#
She was my boss when I was Forzelotte's minion,
but she caused an incident, got demoted, and
ended up answering to me.
#
We've had a physical relationship ever since
then.

<name "Meryl" "!HA0032">
"Okay, on to the next report."

 your body?"
#
<name "Meryl" "!HA0034">
"Yes, sir.
 I think that report is best investigated
 personally."
#
<name "Darx">
"Yeah."
#
I thrust my hips and push her upward.
#
<background "ev055b01.agf" 10>

And then she falls, plunging my dick deep into
her pussy.

"Aah! Ah! Aaah!"
#
Despite forcing me to come twice, she hasn't

She must've been holding back.

I don't feel too bad.
#
I've got time...
#
I should do it soon.
#
I close my eyes.
#
<music 15>
<background "bg017a0.agf" 10>
And focus on my other body.
#
The mass of tentacles.
#
It feels like my entire body is being 
transformed.
#
It's pretty violent.
#
Like being torn apart and put back together.
#
And I can feel all aggressive emotions flooding
into me.
#
I'm aware of it all.
#
A strange calmness.
#
And then light blinds me.
#
<background "bg018a0.agf" 10>
<music 22>
<background "ev069a00.agf" 10>
First, sight comes back.
#
Angels wrapped in tentacles.
#
And then hearing.
#
<name "Writhing Angel" "!QB0076">
"Aah...mm...mmm...ah...
 Nooo..."
#
<name "Panting Angel" "!WB0069">
"Ah... D-Don't... No...

 Mmmm..."
#
<name "Resistant Angel" "!TC0069">
"Ah... Damn it... T-This is...
 Aah! I-Inside again...
 I-I'll kill... ah!
 I'm going to kill you!"
#
Moans, resentment, and the sounds of tentacles
wrapping around the angels...
All sounds I'm used to.
#
As I recognize the sounds, an overwhelming
sensation hits me.
#
My whole body is tentacles.
Everything is a hand, a mouth, a dick.
#
At the start, I couldn't stand the sensations
and threw up over and over again.
#
I even passed out.
#
But after doing it many times, I finally got
used to it.
#
My other body.
#
My mind inside that body.
#
Its memory suddenly floods into me.
#
It's like it's being forced into my head.
#
But now I understand the situation.
#
Well, it doesn't change anything.
#
These angels were thrown into this room.
#
It's just attacking them.
#
That's obvious.
#
These angels were taken prisoner after the
castles fell.
#
I took their virginity and raped them.
#
Even after all this time, they haven't given
in.
#
These are the ones that are regularly thrown
to my body.
#
<name "Writhing Angel" "!QB0077">
"Ah...aah...aaah...
 Forgive me...
 Aaah!"
#
<name "Panting Angel" "!WB0070">
"Aaah! Ah! Aaah! T-That's...aaah!
 No! Ah! Ah! Aaaaah!"
#
<name "Resistant Angel" "!TC0070">
"I swear I'll kill you...
 I swear...
 Ah...aah...ah!"
#
Despite how calmly I can think right now, my
body instinctively always hungers for women.
The tentacles move dextrously and lust for
their bodies.
#
The act is intense.
#
Their legs are forcibly spead, and thick
tentacles are thrust into their unprotected
holes.
#
It's the same feeling as if my dick was in 
them, but with the fine movements as if it was
my fingers.
#
The tentacles writhe inside their holes.
#
In and out, but also growing and shrinking,
rotating, and vibrating.
#
Stirring up their holes with each little
movement.
#
If it's too hard to go too deep, thinner
tentacles sprout from the tips to go deeper.
#
<name "Writhing Angel" "!QB0078">
"Aaaaaah!"
#
And then semen shoots from the tentacles.
#
<background "ev069a01.agf" 10>
<name "Panting Angel" "!WB0071">
"Ah! A-Agin!
 No! Not this!
 Ah! Aaah!"
#
Anywhere that could be filled normally, the
tentacles are sure to flood.
#
In every way possible.
#
But I also feel like I'm controlling every
single one of them.
#
The pleasure is overwhelming.
#
I continue to give in to my instincts and
violate the angels.
#
<background "bg017a0.agf" 10>
<music 5>
<background "bg011b0.agf" 10>
I slowly open my eyes.
#
It's my own body.
#
<name "Darx">
"Whew..."
#
I try to regularly move my mind into that
body.
#
It doesn't need to be for a long time, but it
does need to be done regularly.
#
At least, that's what I was told by the Great
Overlord who taught me how to create it.
#
He said that's the best way to sort out the
emotions in my other body.
#
It's easy to understand why.
If left alone for too long, you get pulled too
deep into its own sensations and it becomes
hard to come back.
#
That would be very bad.
#
Or rather, dangerous.
#
Honestly, I'd prefer not to use it.
#
But I need it.
#
Yeah.
#
I need it.

<music 22>
<background "ev069a00.agf" 10>
<name "Panting Angel" "!QB0079">
"Aaah..."
#
I connect my mind to my other body.
#
All at once, my thoughts are swallowed by
instinct and violently violating the body of
these angels.
#
...
#
A long time ago, I was an adventurer.
I attacked Forzelotte, and lost.
#
As I was dying, she saved me by forcing her
mana into me.
#
I'm grateful for that.
#
But that also changed my entire life.
#
First, by obtaining her mana, I became someone
who could physically touch her without dying.
#
She usually involuntarily absorbs mana around
her.
#
She can't control it, and those made of mana,
like demons of the Netherworld or angels of
Celestia, can be obliterated just by touching
her.
#
That's why she kept her distance from 
everybody and was alone, even though she was
Overlord.
#
That's what began my relationship with her.
#
After that, mana started gathering in me, and
I could use it.
#
As somebody who always dreamed of being able
to use magic, I was a little happy.
#
And finally...
#
The immense power of Forzelotte's mana inside
me gathered mana as well, but not as much as
she did.
#
If I was a regular demon, it would just have
been useful.
But for a human like me, that would be fatal.
#
Mana is basically poison to humans.
#
Expose a human soul to enough mana, and it'll
shatter.
#
In the worst case, their entire body will be
transformed into some kind of mutant creature
without any human thoughts left.
#
That would have happened to me after not too
long.
#
To avoid it, or at least slow it, I had to
release the mana that was inside me.
#
The best way to do that is sex.
#
I had a lot of sex.
#
Because I didn't want to die.
#
At first, with anybody.
#
Eventually, I had enough freedom to choose.
#
Those I loved, and my enemies.
#
Of course, I was gentle with the ones I love.
And merciless to my enemies.
#
And because of the castle incident, there were
plenty of enemies.
#
I fucked the angels, and in the process, 
learned how to take mana away from them, or
force it into them.
#
Since then, I've been able to control my mana
however I want, and accumulated enough to make
another body.
#
But that's not why this body is so different
from mine.
#
Just like always, I absorbed mana around me,
and had to have sex with women so I didn't
absorb too much.
#
But then problems started happening.
#
The fights over the castles never stopped,
and there was so much work to be done 
rebuilding.
I didn't have time for sex.
#
So I relied on my other body.
#
I'm connected to it by mana, so when it has
sex, a little bit of my mana is released.
#
I pity the women who have to deal with it,
but it's very convenient for me.
#
Well, because of that, I still need to 
connect to it every now and then, but that's
still better than before.
#
Just as things were starting to settle down,
and I was thinking about getting rid of that
body and going back to doing it myself,
Macdo showed up.
#
I still need that body for a while longer.
#
...
#
<background "ev069a01.agf" 10>
<name "Panting Angel" "!QB0080">
"Aah..."
#
As I'm lost in thoughts, my tentacles 
mercilessly violate the angel until she passes
out.
#
And then they slowly release her and wriggle
in search of their next prey.

Okay...
#
I summon my mana.
#
That said, I'm doing something with my other
body.
#
I can pull a tentacle out at will near me.
#
I'm able to control it just like it's one of
my own limbs.
#
But making a whole body that can exist
completely separate from me takes a lot of
time and effort.
#
I'm practicing just creating a tiny body.
#
One tentacle.
#
It's... about the same size as my dick.
#
It's hard to send my mind into something this
small.
#
It's so tiny that my senses don't fit right.
#
And when it's this small, it doesn't have any
mind of its own either.
#
Just like the one back in Forzelotte's Shrine,
it needs to be a certain size before it has any
will of its own, and it still can't actually
think or decide for itself.
#
This tiny tentacle sits in my hand.
#
Is it useless?
#
No, it's not.
#
<sprite "ta34a000.agf" 4 4 11>

I am.

And it moves kind of like the tentacle.

It's too bad, but I let go of the feeling.

Doing it there isn't all that different from 
doing it outdoors.
#
But it's just not the same.
#
Doing it on the balcony of the Overlord's 
Retreat isn't bad, but doing it in the middle
of the day in the city really turns me on.
#
If you listen closely, you can hear crowds of
people.
#
There's the excitement that you could be caught
at any moment.
#
And you can look up at the bright sun.
#
It's a setting completely unfitting for what
we're doing, and makes my hips thrust even
harder.
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5012">
"Aah! Mm! Aah! Ah! Ahh! Aah! Ahh!"
#
Well, this hallway is blocked by guards, so
there's virtually no chance regular people will
see us.
#
I want her even more, and she lusts for more
pleasure too.

"Mm! Ah! O-Overlord! Aaah!
 So fast...
 Ah! Mm! M-My voice..
 Mmmmmmm!"
#
<name "Darx">
"Hold it in."
#
No matter what I say, I have no intention of
holding back.
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5014">
"Mm! Mmm! Oohh! Aaah! Ah! Aah! Aaah!"
#
I thrust intensely, stirring up her pussy
while caressing her breasts, kissing her, and 
licking her face.
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5015">
"Aahhh..."
#
She's very familiar with all of it.
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5016">

#
<name "Darx">
"Marilias."
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5017">
"Aah...
 O-Overlord..."
#
I bite her breast hard, plunge deep inside her,
and start to come.
#
<background "ev091a03.agf" 10>
<name "Marialis" "!LA5018">
"Mm...ah...ah...aah...
 Aaaaaaahhh!"
#
And at the same time, her pussy squeezes tight
like it's wrapping around me and she has a
big orgasm.
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5019">
"Ah...aah...ah...aaah..."
#
I thought her climax would be small...
#
<name "Darx">
"Doing it like this is nice and new, isn't it?"
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5020">
"Aah...ah...
 Y-Yes..."
#
Same as me, she really enjoyed the newness of
doing it outside in the city.
#
<name "Darx">
"Well, if we overdo it, it'll bother people
 around us, so maybe just once in a while."
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5021">
"Mmm... Y-Yes, although..."
#
<name "Darx">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5022">
"Could we do it a little more?"
#
<name "Darx">
"..."
#
I stayed with her there until the sun set.

"I-I'm sorry... Aaah! Mmm!

 Not like... that... Slower... 
 Ah! M-My voice... Ah!"
#
I think about the past as I thrust my dick into
her pleasured body.
#
We were enemies at first.
#
It was Castle Baldaquin.
#
The first of Celestia's castles that fell into
the Forest of the Overlord.
#
She was the captain of the invasion forces
they sent.
#
A deadly enemy that caused a massive amount of
damage to Forzelotte's Shrine.
#
After capturing her, I tortured her sexually
until she regretted everything she had done.
#
I took her virginity without caring, along with
countless others.
#
She was treated as just another prisoner, and
not given any preferential treatment.
#
Her pride was crushed, and despite her best
efforts, succumbed to pleasure and in the end,
swore herself to me.
#
After turning, she became a faithful follower,
and is now the commander of my personal guards.
#
And one of my brides who has borne one of my
children.
#

#
<name "Darx">
"I'm going to come."
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5027">
"Ah! Mm!"
#
Instead of saying anything, she spreads her
legs wider, taking a position to make it easier
for me to go as deep as possible inside her.
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5028">
"Ah! Mm! Mm!"
#
When I thrust all the way into her, she 
squeezes hard like she's trying to hold me 
there.
#
<name "Marialis" "!LA5029">
"Mmmmmm!"
#
And she soaks in the climax of her pleasure as
I flood her womb with semen.
