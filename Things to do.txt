======SOMEBODY TEST THIS=====
I think these stat buff passive may be a mess
Oookay. I think it's coming back to me.
The way they work is by appending three strings together.
One for the stat, one for "／" and one for who it affects.
And in BB2, the ／ was replaced by " " and just two words used for each
Like 回避強化／全 became Evasive Leader
But in the exe, that's three separate strings that got appended together.
And it... LOOKS like BB3 is the same way.
But I'd feel better if somebody tested this.
I'm going to make a note of this

ALSO THING

The "Darx Love" passives are really weird. I have no idea if they're working, and there's no matching things elsewhere to verify or tell unlike all the other passives.
